"UnethicalLifeProTips", "selftext": "Hello. \n\nIn 2018 I introduced one billionaire to another and they conducted a trade deal together. I received a finder's fee of 1% which amounted to an 8 figure payout. I was suddenly a multimillionaire overnight. In 2019 I decided to follow through with a plan I had been building up to leave my old life behind and start over somewhere new. This is what I did.\n\n# Prerequisites\n\n- All of this will be much easier if you are not wanted and will not become wanted by any federal / international organizations, whether governmental or private. You don't want people after you. Ideally you have no debts or convictions you're fleeing from.\n\n- Your primary \"enemy\" will be Private Investigators hired by your friends and family. If you have no friends and your family hates you, you are in a good position to do this. Keep in mind that whether your family will look for you usually has nothing to do with whether they personally like you. They can hate you and still try to find you.\n\n- Have money. Easier said than done, but try to have a least $10,000. In a perfect world you're loaded like I was and it makes all of this easier, but let's be real, that isn't the case for you or you wouldn't be here reading this, you'd be hiring private firms to do this for you. Be ready to spend to make this work.\n\n# Preparation\n\nAt least 1 year in advance of your planned disappearance.\n\nHide cash over time by withdrawing small amounts over the course of a year, stashing it in an old packing box in your closet or somewhere inconspicuous. Large withdrawals and lots of small ones draw attention and might get you flagged by your bank. If you get flagged, withdraw from a different account or sell personal items for cash discreetly. I also began making purchases into cryptocurrency at this time, mostly Bitcoin and Ethereum, and in increasingly large amounts. Towards the end I was making purchases in the tens of thousands at a time.\n\nDuring a random trip to Best Buy to get a new TV remote I purchased a prepaid phone with cash. Ensure you never turn the phone on in a location where you also have your current phone. Keep it in the box until it needs to be used.\n\nStart regularly \"forgetting\" your phone at home with increasing frequency for longer and longer portions of the day. This is about creating gaps in telecomm tracking data. Anytime you have your phone and go out, you are being triangulated by celltowers. This data is anonymous but the pattern of movements can be traced to you. There\u2019s only one person who drives the same similar patterns everyday that you do, taking the roads you do to the place you work and the specific roads back to your home. Journalists can figure this out, a PI and law enforcement could too. Leaving your phone at home often breaks this trend in the data and established beforehand with my friends and family that I ended up perfectly fine when I forgot my phone and couldn't be reached immediately.\n\nDuring one or two of these episodes of forgetting your phone, drive to the city center, find an inconspicuous free place you can park at and identify at least 2 walkable locations that are not within sight of cameras.\n\n## Plant Seeds\n\nMonths in advance of your planned disappearance.\n\nThis is where you want to start subconsciously preparing people\u2019s minds to you being gone. There\u2019s a few ways to go about this. My method was telling friends that I was \u201cgetting an itch to move somewhere new\u201d and being very vague about details, often likening it to a passing fancy but bringing it up enough that they might\u2019ve suspected I was serious. Someone else I know told their family members they were talking to someone romantically, were also loose about details, but was also making it clear it was serious. The key is vagueness and deniability.\n\n# Scrub Everything\n\nMonths in advance of your planned disappearance. This step is technically optional but still recommended.\n\nYou want your entire digital existence completely eliminated. Start with social media, these are easiest. Log in to each, and one by one, go through and delete all your posts, comments and history. Is it too much? Sucks. Do it anyways, or hire a service to use a bot to do it for you. Blank everything, your descriptions, profile pictures, delete all you can. Go into settings, figure out how to permanently delete the account. If friends or family ask why you're doing this, tell them it's because you no longer wish to be chronically online and offer your personal phone number to keep in touch.\n\nNext, accounts on obscure websites. Use whatever password manager you have to meticulously go through each website and initiate account deletion with each one. Make sure you hit all the boxes for data deletion as well. Some can take up to 30 days to fully clear everything to do this a few months in advance of you disappearing.\n\nLog into every cloud account you have, Apple, Verizon, Google Drive, whatever it is. Delete everything, all files, emails, photos, contacts, notes, etc. Go into settings and revoke third party access for all applications and linked services. Follow the procedure to permanently delete each account. Some take up to 90 days to fully delete.\n\nWith most of your front-facing digital footprint gone, the unfortunate reality is databases exist. Your information was once available so there\u2019s a log of that somewhere on some computer. You can use services like DeleteMe\u2019s free scan to see where your data is, and Incogni is actually pretty good at requesting a wide range of data removals, but nothing is perfect. If someone really tried, they could find your info through voter records and obscure public lookup sites. If you\u2019ve ever had an Activision account for Call of Duty or World of Warcraft, for example, that will probably outlast humanity on some server. You\u2019ll have to accept that, but you\u2019ve done solid so far and the average joe shouldn\u2019t be able to find anything about you online.\n\n## Taint your Data\n\nCorrupt your personal data going forward. Anything you cannot delete, remove from yourself by presenting it as being taken over by another person or having always been someone else. Change your name to something generically Indian like \u201cRajesh Patel\u201d or some variation as a username if necessary. Search a random topic you\u2019ve never considered being into, begin liking things from that category, repost things that have nothing to do with anything, join random groups for obscure hobbies and interests, friend request a random user and then friend request all their friends and so on. Involve yourself digitally in circles that you would never be part of.\n\n# Physical Removal\n\nWeeks before your planned disappearance.\n\nComputers. Hard drives. Physical drives need to go as well. Use disk wiping software that overwrites the data multiple times and replaces it with random patterns. Open the computer case, remove the HDD, and use a cobalt drill bit on a power tool to drill holes into the drive\u2019s platters in multiple areas. Sand over the platters with sandpaper vigorously. Collect the pieces into mixed piles in small bags, and over the course of a few weeks, scatter the garbage in numerous unrelated waste streams.\n\nSSDs, USBs, SD cards, all of these can be encrypted with a nonsense password and they\u2019re relatively impossible to recover. If you don\u2019t want to bother with that, many SSDs have a Seure Erase ATA command accessible through the BIOS. After or instead of doing those things, open the SSDs or USBs and find the black rectangular NAND flash memory chips, and smash them with a hammer numerous times while they\u2019re inside a plastic bag. Discard similarly in trash cans unrelated to you and not found along your typical routes. Do this during one of the times you've forgotten your phone at home.\n\nIf you have submitted your own DNA to a service like Ancestry or 23andMe, you\u2019re fucked. You will always have this hanging over you.\n\n# Go Time\n\nThe night before.\n\nInstall an encrypted messaging app such as Telegram, Signal or Whatsapp on your phone. If you already have one of these, delete everything on it. You will want these to be visible on your phone\u2019s homescreen. You are planning for the off chance your phone is found when you disappear, and having one of these apps will lead any investigators to assume the details of your whereabouts are lost behind encryption through one of them.\n\nPrepare an inconspicuous backpack / bag. It should include your cash (you\u2019ll want at least a few grand, ideally more than $10k), your wallet, your ID, your current phone, your prepaid phone, a change of clothes you have never been seen wearing before that cover any identifying features (tattoos, piercings, etc.), a mask, a hat, and any other essentials you might need that can\u2019t be easily bought (medications, first aid kit, etc.). Essentials, not sentimentals. You are going to leave your old life behind. This is nothing small. Pack for it.\n\n# Disappearing\n\nDay of.\n\nMake sure your phone is on low battery. Do not let anyone know of your whereabouts or intentions. Should family or friends inquire, give a reasonable answer to the reason you\u2019re going out that can\u2019t be found out to be a lie, so no saying it\u2019s to hang out with someone that can be questioned. You\u2019re starting a new class to learn a new skill today, you\u2019re taking a drive to clear your head, you\u2019re going hiking for a few hours, etc. The longer the fake activity, the better.\n\nTake a car or public transport to the nearest major city center, ideally near a body of water and an airport or near shuttles to the airport. Anytime you are in public, pretend to be on the phone. This charade is for those around you as well as any cameras. Don\u2019t make it obvious you\u2019re looking around for them, but walk around until you\u2019re in an area where you are certain you are not on camera. Change into your other set of clothes, put on your COVID mask, and put a pebble / spiky rock in your shoe to change your gait so your walk isn\u2019t recognizable. Keep your old clothes in your bag. \n\nIf your phone is not already dead, turn it off, remove the SIM card, and stomp your phone until it shatters and bends before discarding it into a body of water. A park pond works, a river is better, as deep into a lake as you can manage is ideal. Distance is key, you don\u2019t want a magnet fisher undoing this randomly months or years later. If you can\u2019t find a body of water, wrap the phone heavily in cloth and dispose of it in a random public trash can. Crack the SIM card if you can and dump it into a nearby sewer grate or manhole cover. Find a garbage can away from view and throw in your wallet, but keep your ID and any other cash. Take a few debit / credit cards out and toss them in separately. This will allude to thieves if found.\n\nWalk to the bus station, pay for a ticket in cash. Greyhound does not require an ID. If your bus station does, detour time. Quickly make your way to the nearest Walmart to purchase a VISA gift card, activate and turn on your prepaid phone, then buy your bus ticket online. Get a ticket to another city, ideally more than a state away from your current location. No small towns. Everyone knows when a new person shows up mysteriously in a small town. No one cares in a big city.\n\n# Short-Term\n\nNew city. Find a place to stay. Walk away from where there\u2019s cameras, use your new phone to identify a nearby hostel that doesn\u2019t require ID. This is increasingly more difficult these days, so a motel might work too. If you can\u2019t avoid giving an ID, do your best to stay off the radar of everyone you interact with. Never stay in one place more than a few nights to start off. The city you've chosen is not the one you're gonna stay at. Stay for a week, two or three max, then purchase another bus ticket to a new city a state or two further away.\n\nChange your name informally. Go with something boring, basic, typical for your age range that could be seen as a nickname or something relatively similar to your real one.\n\nYou can buy fake IDs and fake passports on the darknet as easily as you can buy drugs there too, but they won\u2019t hold up to scrutiny if you\u2019re caught with them, and at that point everything unravels. Passports have encrypted NFC chips in them that are checked at every border, so you better be ready to never travel internationally. If so, good, you can probably use your fake IDs for employers and landlords to prove identity. \n\nScroll around Google Maps in the city you're in, turn on Satellite imagery, find the nearest railroad and go alongside it until you find an abandoned building. You're looking for a dilapidated roof, an empty parking lot / no cars outside, and overgrown unkempt areas nearby. This will be your new temporary address for ordering things online. Pay attention to delivery times and make sure you're nearby to pick up the packages.\n\nIf you're not gonna get a fake ID, you will be using your real ID to get employment and residency somewhere. You are banking on these things not becoming common knowledge and no one reporting you, should it become known you're missing. It's a risk but it's doable. 580,000 people go missing in the US every year, and a lot of them are doing exactly this and succeed to some extent.\n\nDon\u2019t drive much. You shouldn\u2019t have a car with you anyways, but driving opens you up to traffic violations and therefore ID checks by the police. Should you still end up stopped, give them your real ID. If you have a fake, hide it.\n\n# Long-Term\n\nChange your appearance. Drastically. If you have long hair, go bald or shortly shaven, maybe dye it a completely different natural color. Grow a beard, or shave it. Wear a different style of clothing. Wear glasses with weak lenses or switch to contacts if you usually wear glasses.\n\nHealthcare access will be difficult. ERs must legally provide stabilizing treatment and cannot deny you for lacking or refusing to show an ID. They will still try to identify you for billing. Urgent Cares can sometimes accept cash and take minimal info for simple treatments. Long-term and specialized medical care is almost impossible without using your ID.\n\nYou\u2019re in a technological arms race. Facial recognition, data aggregation, biometrics, AI-driven analytics and even keyboard frequency typing analysis can still relate back to your original identity. Things that worked for me in 2019 may be obsolete by now, or may have set a trap to get found out by 2030. It\u2019s impossible to tell.\n\n# Mental Toll\n\nThis will suck. Every part of it. No aspect of this will be easier than your current situation in most cases. The psychological burden of complete isolation, paranoia and inability to form genuine emotional connections without revealing the past will eat you alive. You will miss your friends, your family, and the familiarity of your situation. You need a solid mental fortitude to go through with this and stick with it for the rest of your life.\n\n# Final Thoughts\n\nFor the very long-term, this is where much of my advice wouldn't be useful anymore. I had millions that I still had access to in Bitcoin, so I simply sold off when needed and purchased whatever to make myself comfortable. I hired several people after the fact to go back and ensure my digital existence was mostly erased.

This is what I did.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Prerequisites&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of this will be much easier if you are not wanted and will not become wanted by any federal / international organizations, whether governmental or private. You don&amp;#39;t want people after you. Ideally you have no debts or convictions you&amp;#39;re fleeing from.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your primary &amp;quot;enemy&amp;quot; will be Private Investigators hired by your friends and family. If you have no friends and your family hates you, you are in a good position to do this. Keep in mind that whether your family will look for you usually has nothing to do with whether they personally like you. They can hate you and still try to find you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have money. Easier said than done, but try to have a least $10,000. In a perfect world you&amp;#39;re loaded like I was and it makes all of this easier, but let&amp;#39;s be real, that isn&amp;#39;t the case for you or you wouldn&amp;#39;t be here reading this, you&amp;#39;d be hiring private firms to do this for you. Be ready to spend to make this work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Preparation&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At least 1 year in advance of your planned disappearance.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hide cash over time by withdrawing small amounts over the course of a year, stashing it in an old packing box in your closet or somewhere inconspicuous. Large withdrawals and lots of small ones draw attention and might get you flagged by your bank. If you get flagged, withdraw from a different account or sell personal items for cash discreetly. I also began making purchases into cryptocurrency at this time, mostly Bitcoin and Ethereum, and in increasingly large amounts. Towards the end I was making purchases in the tens of thousands at a time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;During a random trip to Best Buy to get a new TV remote I purchased a prepaid phone with cash. Ensure you never turn the phone on in a location where you also have your current phone. Keep it in the box until it needs to be used.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Start regularly &amp;quot;forgetting&amp;quot; your phone at home with increasing frequency for longer and longer portions of the day. This is about creating gaps in telecomm tracking data. Anytime you have your phone and go out, you are being triangulated by celltowers. This data is anonymous but the pattern of movements can be traced to you. There\u2019s only one person who drives the same similar patterns everyday that you do, taking the roads you do to the place you work and the specific roads back to your home. Journalists can figure this out, a PI and law enforcement could too. Leaving your phone at home often breaks this trend in the data and established beforehand with my friends and family that I ended up perfectly fine when I forgot my phone and couldn&amp;#39;t be reached immediately.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;During one or two of these episodes of forgetting your phone, drive to the city center, find an inconspicuous free place you can park at and identify at least 2 walkable locations that are not within sight of cameras.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Plant Seeds&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Months in advance of your planned disappearance.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is where you want to start subconsciously preparing people\u2019s minds to you being gone. There\u2019s a few ways to go about this. My method was telling friends that I was \u201cgetting an itch to move somewhere new\u201d and being very vague about details, often likening it to a passing fancy but bringing it up enough that they might\u2019ve suspected I was serious. Someone else I know told their family members they were talking to someone romantically, were also loose about details, but was also making it clear it was serious. The key is vagueness and deniability.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Scrub Everything&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Months in advance of your planned disappearance. This step is technically optional but still recommended.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You want your entire digital existence completely eliminated. Start with social media, these are easiest. Log in to each, and one by one, go through and delete all your posts, comments and history. Is it too much? Sucks. Do it anyways, or hire a service to use a bot to do it for you. Blank everything, your descriptions, profile pictures, delete all you can. Go into settings, figure out how to permanently delete the account. If friends or family ask why you&amp;#39;re doing this, tell them it&amp;#39;s because you no longer wish to be chronically online and offer your personal phone number to keep in touch.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Next, accounts on obscure websites. Use whatever password manager you have to meticulously go through each website and initiate account deletion with each one. Make sure you hit all the boxes for data deletion as well. Some can take up to 30 days to fully clear everything to do this a few months in advance of you disappearing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Log into every cloud account you have, Apple, Verizon, Google Drive, whatever it is. Delete everything, all files, emails, photos, contacts, notes, etc. Go into settings and revoke third party access for all applications and linked services. Follow the procedure to permanently delete each account. Some take up to 90 days to fully delete.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With most of your front-facing digital footprint gone, the unfortunate reality is databases exist. Your information was once available so there\u2019s a log of that somewhere on some computer. You can use services like DeleteMe\u2019s free scan to see where your data is, and Incogni is actually pretty good at requesting a wide range of data removals, but nothing is perfect. If someone really tried, they could find your info through voter records and obscure public lookup sites. If you\u2019ve ever had an Activision account for Call of Duty or World of Warcraft, for example, that will probably outlast humanity on some server. You\u2019ll have to accept that, but you\u2019ve done solid so far and the average joe shouldn\u2019t be able to find anything about you online.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Taint your Data&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Corrupt your personal data going forward. Anything you cannot delete, remove from yourself by presenting it as being taken over by another person or having always been someone else. Change your name to something generically Indian like \u201cRajesh Patel\u201d or some variation as a username if necessary. Search a random topic you\u2019ve never considered being into, begin liking things from that category, repost things that have nothing to do with anything, join random groups for obscure hobbies and interests, friend request a random user and then friend request all their friends and so on. Involve yourself digitally in circles that you would never be part of.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Physical Removal&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Weeks before your planned disappearance.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Computers. Hard drives. Physical drives need to go as well. Use disk wiping software that overwrites the data multiple times and replaces it with random patterns. Open the computer case, remove the HDD, and use a cobalt drill bit on a power tool to drill holes into the drive\u2019s platters in multiple areas. Sand over the platters with sandpaper vigorously. Collect the pieces into mixed piles in small bags, and over the course of a few weeks, scatter the garbage in numerous unrelated waste streams.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;SSDs, USBs, SD cards, all of these can be encrypted with a nonsense password and they\u2019re relatively impossible to recover. If you don\u2019t want to bother with that, many SSDs have a Seure Erase ATA command accessible through the BIOS. After or instead of doing those things, open the SSDs or USBs and find the black rectangular NAND flash memory chips, and smash them with a hammer numerous times while they\u2019re inside a plastic bag. Discard similarly in trash cans unrelated to you and not found along your typical routes. Do this during one of the times you&amp;#39;ve forgotten your phone at home.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you have submitted your own DNA to a service like Ancestry or 23andMe, you\u2019re fucked. You will always have this hanging over you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Go Time&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The night before.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Install an encrypted messaging app such as Telegram, Signal or Whatsapp on your phone. If you already have one of these, delete everything on it. You will want these to be visible on your phone\u2019s homescreen. You are planning for the off chance your phone is found when you disappear, and having one of these apps will lead any investigators to assume the details of your whereabouts are lost behind encryption through one of them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Prepare an inconspicuous backpack / bag. It should include your cash (you\u2019ll want at least a few grand, ideally more than $10k), your wallet, your ID, your current phone, your prepaid phone, a change of clothes you have never been seen wearing before that cover any identifying features (tattoos, piercings, etc.), a mask, a hat, and any other essentials you might need that can\u2019t be easily bought (medications, first aid kit, etc.). Essentials, not sentimentals. You are going to leave your old life behind. This is nothing small. Pack for it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Disappearing&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Day of.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Make sure your phone is on low battery. Do not let anyone know of your whereabouts or intentions. Should family or friends inquire, give a reasonable answer to the reason you\u2019re going out that can\u2019t be found out to be a lie, so no saying it\u2019s to hang out with someone that can be questioned. You\u2019re starting a new class to learn a new skill today, you\u2019re taking a drive to clear your head, you\u2019re going hiking for a few hours, etc. The longer the fake activity, the better.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Take a car or public transport to the nearest major city center, ideally near a body of water and an airport or near shuttles to the airport. Anytime you are in public, pretend to be on the phone. This charade is for those around you as well as any cameras. Don\u2019t make it obvious you\u2019re looking around for them, but walk around until you\u2019re in an area where you are certain you are not on camera. Change into your other set of clothes, put on your COVID mask, and put a pebble / spiky rock in your shoe to change your gait so your walk isn\u2019t recognizable. Keep your old clothes in your bag. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If your phone is not already dead, turn it off, remove the SIM card, and stomp your phone until it shatters and bends before discarding it into a body of water. A park pond works, a river is better, as deep into a lake as you can manage is ideal. Distance is key, you don\u2019t want a magnet fisher undoing this randomly months or years later. If you can\u2019t find a body of water, wrap the phone heavily in cloth and dispose of it in a random public trash can. Crack the SIM card if you can and dump it into a nearby sewer grate or manhole cover. Find a garbage can away from view and throw in your wallet, but keep your ID and any other cash. Take a few debit / credit cards out and toss them in separately. This will allude to thieves if found.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Walk to the bus station, pay for a ticket in cash. Greyhound does not require an ID. If your bus station does, detour time. Quickly make your way to the nearest Walmart to purchase a VISA gift card, activate and turn on your prepaid phone, then buy your bus ticket online. Get a ticket to another city, ideally more than a state away from your current location. No small towns. Everyone knows when a new person shows up mysteriously in a small town. No one cares in a big city.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Short-Term&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;New city. Find a place to stay. Walk away from where there\u2019s cameras, use your new phone to identify a nearby hostel that doesn\u2019t require ID. This is increasingly more difficult these days, so a motel might work too. If you can\u2019t avoid giving an ID, do your best to stay off the radar of everyone you interact with. Never stay in one place more than a few nights to start off. The city you&amp;#39;ve chosen is not the one you&amp;#39;re gonna stay at. Stay for a week, two or three max, then purchase another bus ticket to a new city a state or two further away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Change your name informally. Go with something boring, basic, typical for your age range that could be seen as a nickname or something relatively similar to your real one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can buy fake IDs and fake passports on the darknet as easily as you can buy drugs there too, but they won\u2019t hold up to scrutiny if you\u2019re caught with them, and at that point everything unravels. Passports have encrypted NFC chips in them that are checked at every border, so you better be ready to never travel internationally. If so, good, you can probably use your fake IDs for employers and landlords to prove identity. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Scroll around Google Maps in the city you&amp;#39;re in, turn on Satellite imagery, find the nearest railroad and go alongside it until you find an abandoned building. You&amp;#39;re looking for a dilapidated roof, an empty parking lot / no cars outside, and overgrown unkempt areas nearby. This will be your new temporary address for ordering things online. Pay attention to delivery times and make sure you&amp;#39;re nearby to pick up the packages.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re not gonna get a fake ID, you will be using your real ID to get employment and residency somewhere. You are banking on these things not becoming common knowledge and no one reporting you, should it become known you&amp;#39;re missing. It&amp;#39;s a risk but it&amp;#39;s doable. 580,000 people go missing in the US every year, and a lot of them are doing exactly this and succeed to some extent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don\u2019t drive much. You shouldn\u2019t have a car with you anyways, but driving opens you up to traffic violations and therefore ID checks by the police. Should you still end up stopped, give them your real ID. If you have a fake, hide it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Long-Term&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Change your appearance. Drastically. If you have long hair, go bald or shortly shaven, maybe dye it a completely different natural color. Grow a beard, or shave it. Wear a different style of clothing. Wear glasses with weak lenses or switch to contacts if you usually wear glasses.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Healthcare access will be difficult. ERs must legally provide stabilizing treatment and cannot deny you for lacking or refusing to show an ID. They will still try to identify you for billing. Urgent Cares can sometimes accept cash and take minimal info for simple treatments. Long-term and specialized medical care is almost impossible without using your ID.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You\u2019re in a technological arms race. Facial recognition, data aggregation, biometrics, AI-driven analytics and even keyboard frequency typing analysis can still relate back to your original identity. Things that worked for me in 2019 may be obsolete by now, or may have set a trap to get found out by 2030. It\u2019s impossible to tell.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Mental Toll&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This will suck. Every part of it. No aspect of this will be easier than your current situation in most cases. The psychological burden of complete isolation, paranoia and inability to form genuine emotional connections without revealing the past will eat you alive. You will miss your friends, your family, and the familiarity of your situation. You need a solid mental fortitude to go through with this and stick with it for the rest of your life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For the very long-term, this is where much of my advice wouldn&amp;#39;t be useful anymore. I had millions that I still had access to in Bitcoin, so I simply sold off when needed and purchased whatever to make myself comfortable. I hired several people after the fact to go back and ensure my digital existence was mostly erased. It&amp;#39;s been years now, I figure I&amp;#39;m alright.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": true, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "1e492714-f71c-11e8-8cb0-0e49836910ba", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_3cx36", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#ff66ac", "id": "1kogiwk", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "HazeBullion", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 317, "send_replies": true, "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/UnethicalLifeProTips/comments/1kogiwk/ulpt_how_to_disappear/", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UnethicalLifeProTips/comments/1kogiwk/ulpt_how_to_disappear/", "subreddit_subscribers": 2117484, "created_utc": 1747442814.0, "num_crossposts": 1, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "homelab", "selftext": "The rack is fully 3D printed.
