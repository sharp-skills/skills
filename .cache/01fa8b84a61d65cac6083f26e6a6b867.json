We encourage the community to remix, redesign, and reshare MinIO under the terms of the AGPLv3 license.\n\nAll usage of MinIO in your application stack requires validation against AGPLv3 obligations, which include but are not limited to the release of modified code to the community from which you have benefited. Any commercial/proprietary usage of the AGPLv3 software, including repackaging or reselling services/features, is done at your own risk.\n\nThe AGPLv3 provides no obligation by any party to support, maintain, or warranty the original or any modified work.\nAll support is provided on a best-effort basis through Github and our [Slack](https://slack.min.io) channel, and any member of the community is welcome to contribute and assist others in their usage of the software.\n\nMinIO [AIStor](https://www.min.io/product/aistor) includes enterprise-grade support and licensing for workloads which require commercial or proprietary usage and production-level SLA/SLO-backed support. For more information, [reach out for a quote](https://min.io/pricing).\n\n## Source-Only Distribution\n\n**Important:** The MinIO community edition is now distributed as source code only. We will no longer provide pre-compiled binary releases for the community version.\n\n### Installing Latest MinIO Community Edition\n\nTo use MinIO community edition, you have two options:\n\n1. **Install from source** using `go install github.com/minio/minio@latest` (recommended)\n2. **Build a Docker image** from the provided Dockerfile\n\nSee the sections below for detailed instructions on each method.\n\n### Legacy Binary Releases\n\nHistorical pre-compiled binary releases remain available for reference but are no longer maintained:\n\n- GitHub Releases: https://github.com/minio/minio/releases\n- Direct downloads: https://dl.min.io/server/minio/release/\n\n**These legacy binaries will not receive updates.** We strongly recommend using source builds for access to the latest features, bug fixes, and security updates.\n\n## Install from Source\n\nUse the following commands to compile and run a standalone MinIO server from source.\nIf you do not have a working Golang environment, please follow [How to install Golang](https://golang.org/doc/install). Minimum version required is [go1.24](https://golang.org/dl/#stable)\n\n```sh\ngo install github.com/minio/minio@latest\n```\n\nYou can alternatively run `go build` and use the `GOOS` and `GOARCH` environment variables to control the OS and architecture target.\nFor example:\n\n```\nenv GOOS=linux GOARCH=arm64 go build\n```\n\nStart MinIO by running `minio server PATH` where `PATH` is any empty folder on your local filesystem.\n\nThe MinIO deployment starts using default root credentials `minioadmin:minioadmin`.\nYou can test the deployment using the MinIO Console, an embedded web-based object browser built into MinIO Server.\nPoint a web browser running on the host machine to <http://127.0.0.1:9000> and log in with the root credentials.\nYou can use the Browser to create buckets, upload objects, and browse the contents of the MinIO server.\n\nYou can also connect using any S3-compatible tool, such as the MinIO Client `mc` commandline tool:\n\n```sh\nmc alias set local http://localhost:9000 minioadmin minioadmin\nmc admin info local\n```\n\nSee [Test using MinIO Client `mc`](#test-using-minio-client-mc) for more information on using the `mc` commandline tool.\nFor application developers, see <https://docs.min.io/enterprise/aistor-object-store/developers/sdk/> to view MinIO SDKs for supported languages.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> Production environments using compiled-from-source MinIO binaries do so at their own risk.\n> The AGPLv3 license provides no warranties nor liabilities for any such usage.\n\n## Build Docker Image\n\nYou can use the `docker build .` command to build a Docker image on your local host machine.\nYou must first [build MinIO](#install-from-source) and ensure the `minio` binary exists in the project root.\n\nThe following command builds the Docker image using the default `Dockerfile` in the root project directory with the repository and image tag `myminio:minio`\n\n```sh\ndocker build -t myminio:minio .\n```\n\nUse `docker image ls` to confirm the image exists in your local repository.\nYou can run the server using standard Docker invocation:\n\n```sh\ndocker run -p 9000:9000 -p 9001:9001 myminio:minio server /tmp/minio --console-address :9001\n```\n\nComplete documentation for building Docker containers, managing custom images, or loading images into orchestration platforms is out of scope for this documentation.\nYou can modify the `Dockerfile` and `dockerscripts/docker-entrypoint.sh` as-needed to reflect your specific image requirements.\n\nSee the [MinIO Container](https://docs.min.io/community/minio-object-store/operations/deployments/baremetal-deploy-minio-as-a-container.html#deploy-minio-container) documentation for more guidance on running MinIO within a Container image.\n\n## Install using Helm Charts\n\nThere are two paths for installing MinIO onto Kubernetes infrastructure:\n\n- Use the [MinIO Operator](https://github.com/minio/operator)\n- Use the community-maintained [Helm charts](https://github.com/minio/minio/tree/master/helm/minio)\n\nSee the [MinIO Documentation](https://docs.min.io/community/minio-object-store/operations/deployments/kubernetes.html) for guidance on deploying using the Operator.\nThe Community Helm chart has instructions in the folder-level README.\n\n## Test MinIO Connectivity\n\n### Test using MinIO Console\n\nMinIO Server comes with an embedded web based object browser.\nPoint your web browser to <http://127.0.0.1:9000> to ensure your server has started successfully.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> MinIO runs console on random port by default, if you wish to choose a specific port use `--console-address` to pick a specific interface and port.\n\n### Test using MinIO Client `mc`\n\n`mc` provides a modern alternative to UNIX commands like ls, cat, cp, mirror, diff etc. It supports filesystems and Amazon S3 compatible cloud storage services.\n\nThe following commands set a local alias, validate the server information, create a bucket, copy data to that bucket, and list the contents of the bucket.\n\n```sh\nmc alias set local http://localhost:9000 minioadmin minioadmin\nmc admin info\nmc mb data\nmc cp ~/Downloads/mydata data/\nmc ls data/\n```\n\nFollow the MinIO Client [Quickstart Guide](https://docs.min.io/community/minio-object-store/reference/minio-mc.html#quickstart) for further instructions.\n\n## Explore Further\n\n- [The MinIO documentation
