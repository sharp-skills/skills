{"d": "Parse CSV with JavaScript\n========================================\n\nPapa Parse is the fastest in-browser CSV (or delimited text) parser for JavaScript. It is reliable and correct according to [RFC 4180](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4180), and it comes with these features:\n\n- Easy to use\n- Parse CSV files directly (local or over the network)\n- Fast mode\n- Stream large files (even via HTTP)\n- Reverse parsing (converts JSON to CSV)\n- Auto-detect delimiter\n- Worker threads to keep your web page reactive\n- Header row support\n- Pause, resume, abort\n- Can convert numbers and booleans to their types\n- Optional jQuery integration to get files from `<input type=\"file\">` elements\n- One of the only parsers that correctly handles line-breaks and quotations\n\nPapa Parse has **no dependencies** - not even jQuery.\n\nInstall\n-------\n\npapaparse is available on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/papaparse). It\ncan be installed with the following command:\n```shell\nnpm install papaparse\n```\n\nIf you don't want to use npm, [papaparse.min.js](https://unpkg.com/papaparse@latest/papaparse.min.js) can be downloaded to your project source.\n\nUsage\n-----\n```js\nimport Papa from 'papaparse';\n\nPapa.parse(file, config);\n    \nconst csv = Papa.unparse(data[, config]);\n```\n\nHomepage & Demo\n----------------\n\n- [Homepage](https://www.papaparse.com)\n- [Demo](https://www.papaparse.com/demo)\n\nTo learn how to use Papa Parse:\n\n- [Documentation](https://www.papaparse.com/docs)\n\nThe website is hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). Its content is also included in the docs folder of this repository. If you want to contribute on it just clone the master of this repository and open a pull request.\n\n\nPapa Parse for Node\n--------------------\n\nPapa Parse can parse a [Readable Stream](https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_readable_streams) instead of a [File](https://www.w3.org/TR/FileAPI/) when used in Node.js environments (in addition to plain strings). In this mode, `encoding` must, if specified, be a Node-supported character encoding. The `Papa.LocalChunkSize`, `Papa.RemoteChunkSize` , `download`, `withCredentials` and `worker` config options are unavailable.\n\nPapa Parse can also parse in a node streaming style which makes `.pipe` available.  Simply pipe the [Readable Stream](https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_readable_streams) to the stream returned from `Papa.parse(Papa.NODE_STREAM_INPUT, options)`.  The `Papa.LocalChunkSize`, `Papa.RemoteChunkSize` , `download`, `withCredentials`, `worker`, `step`, and `complete` config options are unavailable.  To register a callback with the stream to process data, use the `data` event like so: `stream.on('data', callback)` and to signal the end of stream, use the 'end' event like so: `stream.on('end', callback)`.\n\nGet Started\n-----------\n\nFor usage instructions, see the [homepage](https://www.papaparse.com) and, for more detail, the [documentation](https://www.papaparse.com/docs).\n\nTests\n-----\n\nPapa Parse is under test. Download this repository, run `npm install`, then `npm test` to run the tests.\n\nContributing\n------------\n\nTo discuss a new feature or ask a question, open an issue.
