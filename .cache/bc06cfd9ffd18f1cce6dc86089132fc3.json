But cutting ties won\u2019t be easy.\n\n&gt; The global backlash against the second Donald Trump administration keeps on growing. Canadians have boycotted US-made products, anti\u2013Elon Musk posters have appeared across London amid widespread Tesla protests, and European officials have drastically increased military spending as US support for Ukraine falters. Dominant US tech services may be the next focus.\n\n&gt; There are early signs that some European companies and governments are souring on their use of American cloud services provided by the three so-called hyperscalers. Between them, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, and Amazon Web Services (AWS) host vast swathes of the internet and keep thousands of businesses running. However, some organizations appear to be reconsidering their use of these companies\u2019 cloud services\u2014including servers, storage, and databases\u2014citing uncertainties around privacy and data access fears under the Trump administration.\n\n&gt; \u201cThere\u2019s a huge appetite in Europe to de-risk or decouple the over-dependence on US tech companies, because there is a concern that they could be weaponized against European interests,\u201d says Marietje Schaake, a nonresident fellow at Stanford\u2019s Cyber Policy Center and a former, decade-long member of the European Parliament.\n\n&gt; The moves may already be underway. On March 18, politicians in the Netherlands House of Representatives passed eight motions asking the government to reduce reliance on US tech companies and move to European alternatives. Days before, more than 100 organizations signed an open letter to European officials calling for the continent to become \u201cmore technologically independent\u201d and saying the status quo creates \u201csecurity and reliability risks.\u201d\n\n&gt; Two European-based cloud service companies, Exoscale and Elastx, tell WIRED they have seen an uptick in potential customers looking to abandon US cloud providers over the last two weeks\u2014with some already starting to make the jump. Multiple technology advisers say they are having widespread discussions about what it would take to uproot services, data, and systems.\n\n&gt; \u201cWe have more demand from across Europe,\u201d says Mathias N\u00f6bauer, the CEO of Swiss-based hosting provider Exoscale, adding there has been an increase in new customers seeking to move away from cloud giants. \u201cSome customers were very explicit,\u201d N\u00f6bauer says. \u201cEspecially customers from Denmark being very explicit that they want to move away from US hyperscalers because of the US administration and what they said about Greenland.\u201d\n\n&gt; \u201cIt's a big worry about the uncertainty around everything. And from the Europeans\u2019 perspective\u2014that the US is maybe not on the same team as us any longer,\u201d says Joakim \u00d6hman, the CEO of Swedish cloud provider Elastx. \u201cThose are the drivers that bring people or organizations to look at alternatives.\u201d\n\n&gt; Concerns have been raised about the current data-sharing agreement between the EU and US, which is designed to allow information to move between the two continents while protecting people\u2019s rights. Multiple previous versions of the agreement have been struck down by European courts. At the end of January, Trump fired three Democrats from the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board (PCLOB), which helps manage the current agreement. The move could undermine or increase uncertainty around the agreement. In addition, \u00d6hman says, he has heard concerns from firms about the CLOUD Act, which can allow US law enforcement to subpoena user data from tech companies, potentially including data that is stored in systems outside of the US.\n\n&gt; Dave Cottlehuber, the founder of SkunkWerks, a small tech infrastructure firm in Austria, says he has been moving the company\u2019s few servers and databases away from US providers to European services since the start of the year. \u201cFirst and foremost, it\u2019s about values,\u201d Cottlehuber says. \u201cFor me, privacy is a right not a privilege.\u201d Cottlehuber says the decision to move is easier for a small business such as his, but he argues it removes some taxes that are paid to the Trump administration. \u201cThe best thing I can do is to remove that small contribution of mine, and also at the same time, make sure that my customers\u2019 privacy is respected and preserved,\u201d Cottlehuber says.\n\n&gt; Steffen Schmidt, the CEO of Medicusdata, a company that provides text-to-speech services to doctors and hospitals in Europe, says that having data in Europe has always \u201cbeen a must,\u201d but his customers have been asking for more in recent weeks. \u201cSince the beginning of 2025, in addition to data residency guarantees, customers have actively asked us to use cloud providers that are natively European companies,\u201d Schmidt says, adding that some of his services have been moved to N\u00f6bauer\u2019s Exoscale.\n\n&gt; Harry Staight, a spokesperson for AWS, says it is \u201cnot accurate\u201d that customers are moving from AWS to EU alternatives. \u201cOur customers have control over where they store their data and how it is encrypted, and we make the AWS Cloud sovereign-by-design,\u201d Straight says. \u201cAWS services support encryption with customer managed keys that are inaccessible to AWS, which means customers have complete control of who accesses their data.\u201d Staight says the membership of the PCLOB \u201cdoes not impact\u201d the agreements around EU-US data sharing and that the CLOUD Act has \u201cadditional safeguards for cloud content.\u201d Google and Microsoft declined to comment.\n\n&gt; The potential shift away from US tech firms is not just linked to cloud providers. Since January 15, visitors to the European Alternatives website increased more than 1,200 percent. The site lists everything from music streaming services to DDoS protection tools, says Marko Saric, a cofounder of European cloud analytics service Plausible. \u201cWe can certainly feel that something is going on,\u201d Saric says, claiming that during the first 18 days of March the company has \u201cbeaten\u201d the net recurring revenue growth it saw in January and February. \u201cThis is organic growth which cannot be explained by any seasonality or our activities,\u201d he says.\n\n&gt; While there are signs of movement, the impact is likely to be small\u2014at least for now. Around the world, governments and businesses use multiple cloud services\u2014such as authentication measures, hosting, data storage, and increasingly data centers providing AI processing\u2014from the big three cloud and tech service providers. Cottlehuber says that, for large businesses, it may take many months, if not longer, to consider what needs to be moved, the risks involved, plus actually changing systems. \u201cWhat happens if you have a hundred petabytes of storage, it's going to take years to move over the internet,\u201d he says.\n\n&gt; For years, European companies have struggled to compete with the likes of Google, Microsoft, and Amazon\u2019s cloud services and technical infrastructure, which make billions every year. It may also be difficult to find similar services on the scale of those provided by alternative European cloud firms.\n\n&gt; \u201cIf you are deep into the hyperscaler cloud ecosystem, you\u2019ll struggle to find equivalent services elsewhere,\u201d says Bert Hubert, an entrepreneur and former government regulator, who says he has heard of multiple new cloud migrations to US firms being put on hold or reconsidered. Hubert has argued that it is no longer \u201csafe\u201d for European governments to be moved to US clouds and that European alternatives can\u2019t properly compete. \u201cWe sell a lot of fine wood here in Europe. But not that much furniture,\u201d he says. However, that too could change.\n\n&gt; Schaake, the former member of the European Parliament, says a combination of new investments, a different approach to buying public services, and a Europe-first approach or investing in a European technology stack could help to stimulate any wider moves on the continent. \u201cThe dramatic shift of the Trump administration is very tangible,\u201d Schaake says. \u201cThe idea that anything could happen and that Europe should fend for itself is clear. Now we need to see the same kind of pace and leadership that we see with defense to actually turn this into meaningful action.\u201d\n\n**Credit:** *(Matt Burgess is a senior writer at WIRED focused on information security, privacy, and data regulation in Europe.

Take a look at it, it's titled [\"New downstairs apartment neighbor, kid loves to scream. Is my way of handling it reasonable?](https://www.reddit.com/r/neighborsfromhell/comments/1khs1qy/new_downstairs_apartment_neighbor_kid_loves_to/)\n\nAbout 3 weeks ago, I decided to start recording the screams of my neighbors 3-4 y/o kid and reported it to management. Management talked to them, and the downstairs neighbor would \"work on it\". The neighbor the next day then made a retaliatory complaint about me saying I walk loud (I'm on the top floor, shes on the bottom).\n\nThe neighbor left for 9 days and took the kid somewhere else, I thought wow, maybe they broke the lease and now I'm free of these gremlins. But something in my heart told me, \"this isn't over yet\". These types of people are just too dumb and too self righteous to leave without a fight. So me, expecting a war, purchased and installed two nest cameras inside my apartment which pick up audio and video 24/7 with cloud storage for 10 days. Yes I was that sure that I was dealing with a wreckless person and had to protect myself.\n\nWhen she got back about a week and a half ago on Monday May 19, boy did she come back with a vengeance. She started pounding on my floor (her ceiling) with a broom handle or something at all hours of the day. Not because I was overly loud, because she was retaliating against the complaint I originally made and she was PISSED. Every time she would bang, she got me more footage. It's funny because in the videos I would narrate myself explaining the entire situation while she was banging on my floor. Sometimes I'd be in the kitchen eating a Dunkin sausage egg and cheese croissant, walk over to the camera, and start saying \"Yes today is 05/22/2025 at 3:02 PM, as you can clearly hear my neighbors downstairs are banging in retaliation to a noise complaint I submitted about them..\" and just go on these mini rants to the camera.\n\nThen things escalated on Sunday 05/25 and she would not stop pounding on my floor around 10:30 PM. She would pound 6-8 times, chill for a bit, then go right back to it. I have to say, I admire her consistency. But I had enough at this point. I don't pay $1300 a month in rent to deal with this shit. So I called the non-emergency police line, waited for 45 min outside my apartment, and let the cops in to ask her whats going on with the noise. She refused to answer the door to the police, but I still got a police incident number and planned to pick the police incident up in paper form in person on Tuesday 05/27, because the police station documentation office is not open on memorial day Monday 05/26.\n\nSo the next day goes by, and it's Monday 05/26.. I hear some loud knocking on my front door. Hmm strange, maybe its the gremlins finally coming to confront me. I ignore it for a minute and it keeps going on. So I said \"Go away\" while showing the nest camera a time stamp of my phone in case it was them. Then they announced they were \"INSERTMYTOWN police department\". Fuck. I opened the door and said \"Hi guys, whats up?\" and they said \"we're hear on a call regarding your interactions with the female downstairs\" and I said \"..are you talking about the incident from yesterday??\" and they said \"No, this is about today, she called dispatch about you 5 minutes ago, can we please come in?\" and I said \"No, but we can go talk downstairs outside the apartment if you'd like.\" and I left the door open so the police could see me as I got a shirt on and came down with them.\n\nThe police asked me what interaction I had with her that day and I said none, as I've never talked to this woman before in my life, which is the truth. I've never spoken to hear or communicated with her in anyway. Then they said that she called dispatch and said:\n\n1) - That I was intoxicated\n\n2) - That I had threatened her from my patio\n\n3) - That she was a single mom with a kid\n\n4) - AND that we had a relationship together (this is a domestic dispute set-up)\n\nSo I showed the cops the video footage of what I was doing for the past hour, literally chilling with my cat, giving him those beloved belly rubs, and tidying up some stuff in my apartment from two angles. They let me go in 5 minutes.\n\nThat was on Monday 05/26, the next day on Tuesday 05/27 I went to the police dept and got a copy of both police incidents, as well as getting her full name from the incident. I also contacted my friend who is a county prosecutor and a lawyer and retained him as my lawyer to start work on a cease and desist letter. He also mentioned, she tried to set me up for a domestic dispute because our county has a rule where if its a domestic dispute they hold you for a minimum of 24 hours.\n\nI then went to management and alerted them that they have a tenant whose been pounding on my floor, providing them all documentation, written notes from Google Docs, videos from Google Drive, and they did not give a shit. They literally said \"b-bu can we just all have a meeting about this? I'm sure we can work it out!\" at that moment I knew how fucked I was. I've been a tenant here for 2 years, plead my case for 20 minutes to prove my innocence and how bad this other tenant was, and their main reply was \"lets all have a meeting together hehe!\" so I said \"sure, I'll bring my lawyer. We're just gonna have to ask her why she falsely informed police that I threatened her so we can pursue legal action against her. That shouldn't be a problem right?\" they replied \"UH OH NO NO NEED TO PAY AN ATTORNEY JUST TO COME TO THIS\". Fucking clown show.\n\nSo throughout the rest of the week I've barely been sleeping, maybe 2 or 3 hours a night. I'm just afraid of her saying something more extreme this time like I'm drunk and have a gun, and the cops kicking my door in and ending my existance. But ALL evidence is on my google drive shared with my lawyer, my family, and an ex that I'm on really good terms with. I've instructed them if I do get jailed or SWAT'd over this, to sue everyone into oblivion and have provided so much documentation they'll have a strong case.  \n\nMy lawyer also finished with the cease and desist letter which I'm sending to the gremlins below today through certified mail. Then I'll be pursuing symbolic damages via small claims court (sueing them for $5 for 5 different reasons, $1 a reason), then building a bigger law suit against them. I'll also be attempting to work with the police to get a charge against them for false informing. I have promised myself and whatever entity is out there in this universe that I will make this woman desolate for trying to ruin my name, frame me for something I didn't do, and potentially jail or have me harmed by police.

Take a look at it, it&amp;#39;s titled &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/neighborsfromhell/comments/1khs1qy/new_downstairs_apartment_neighbor_kid_loves_to/\"&gt;&amp;quot;New downstairs apartment neighbor, kid loves to scream. Is my way of handling it reasonable?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;About 3 weeks ago, I decided to start recording the screams of my neighbors 3-4 y/o kid and reported it to management. Management talked to them, and the downstairs neighbor would &amp;quot;work on it&amp;quot;. The neighbor the next day then made a retaliatory complaint about me saying I walk loud (I&amp;#39;m on the top floor, shes on the bottom).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The neighbor left for 9 days and took the kid somewhere else, I thought wow, maybe they broke the lease and now I&amp;#39;m free of these gremlins. But something in my heart told me, &amp;quot;this isn&amp;#39;t over yet&amp;quot;. These types of people are just too dumb and too self righteous to leave without a fight. So me, expecting a war, purchased and installed two nest cameras inside my apartment which pick up audio and video 24/7 with cloud storage for 10 days. Yes I was that sure that I was dealing with a wreckless person and had to protect myself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When she got back about a week and a half ago on Monday May 19, boy did she come back with a vengeance. She started pounding on my floor (her ceiling) with a broom handle or something at all hours of the day. Not because I was overly loud, because she was retaliating against the complaint I originally made and she was PISSED. Every time she would bang, she got me more footage. It&amp;#39;s funny because in the videos I would narrate myself explaining the entire situation while she was banging on my floor. Sometimes I&amp;#39;d be in the kitchen eating a Dunkin sausage egg and cheese croissant, walk over to the camera, and start saying &amp;quot;Yes today is 05/22/2025 at 3:02 PM, as you can clearly hear my neighbors downstairs are banging in retaliation to a noise complaint I submitted about them..&amp;quot; and just go on these mini rants to the camera.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then things escalated on Sunday 05/25 and she would not stop pounding on my floor around 10:30 PM. She would pound 6-8 times, chill for a bit, then go right back to it. I have to say, I admire her consistency. But I had enough at this point. I don&amp;#39;t pay $1300 a month in rent to deal with this shit. So I called the non-emergency police line, waited for 45 min outside my apartment, and let the cops in to ask her whats going on with the noise. She refused to answer the door to the police, but I still got a police incident number and planned to pick the police incident up in paper form in person on Tuesday 05/27, because the police station documentation office is not open on memorial day Monday 05/26.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So the next day goes by, and it&amp;#39;s Monday 05/26.. I hear some loud knocking on my front door. Hmm strange, maybe its the gremlins finally coming to confront me. I ignore it for a minute and it keeps going on. So I said &amp;quot;Go away&amp;quot; while showing the nest camera a time stamp of my phone in case it was them. Then they announced they were &amp;quot;INSERTMYTOWN police department&amp;quot;. Fuck. I opened the door and said &amp;quot;Hi guys, whats up?&amp;quot; and they said &amp;quot;we&amp;#39;re hear on a call regarding your interactions with the female downstairs&amp;quot; and I said &amp;quot;..are you talking about the incident from yesterday??&amp;quot; and they said &amp;quot;No, this is about today, she called dispatch about you 5 minutes ago, can we please come in?&amp;quot; and I said &amp;quot;No, but we can go talk downstairs outside the apartment if you&amp;#39;d like.&amp;quot; and I left the door open so the police could see me as I got a shirt on and came down with them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The police asked me what interaction I had with her that day and I said none, as I&amp;#39;ve never talked to this woman before in my life, which is the truth. I&amp;#39;ve never spoken to hear or communicated with her in anyway. Then they said that she called dispatch and said:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1) - That I was intoxicated&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2) - That I had threatened her from my patio&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3) - That she was a single mom with a kid&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;4) - AND that we had a relationship together (this is a domestic dispute set-up)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I showed the cops the video footage of what I was doing for the past hour, literally chilling with my cat, giving him those beloved belly rubs, and tidying up some stuff in my apartment from two angles. They let me go in 5 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That was on Monday 05/26, the next day on Tuesday 05/27 I went to the police dept and got a copy of both police incidents, as well as getting her full name from the incident. I also contacted my friend who is a county prosecutor and a lawyer and retained him as my lawyer to start work on a cease and desist letter. He also mentioned, she tried to set me up for a domestic dispute because our county has a rule where if its a domestic dispute they hold you for a minimum of 24 hours.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I then went to management and alerted them that they have a tenant whose been pounding on my floor, providing them all documentation, written notes from Google Docs, videos from Google Drive, and they did not give a shit. They literally said &amp;quot;b-bu can we just all have a meeting about this? I&amp;#39;m sure we can work it out!&amp;quot; at that moment I knew how fucked I was. I&amp;#39;ve been a tenant here for 2 years, plead my case for 20 minutes to prove my innocence and how bad this other tenant was, and their main reply was &amp;quot;lets all have a meeting together hehe!&amp;quot; so I said &amp;quot;sure, I&amp;#39;ll bring my lawyer. We&amp;#39;re just gonna have to ask her why she falsely informed police that I threatened her so we can pursue legal action against her. That shouldn&amp;#39;t be a problem right?&amp;quot; they replied &amp;quot;UH OH NO NO NEED TO PAY AN ATTORNEY JUST TO COME TO THIS&amp;quot;. Fucking clown show.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So throughout the rest of the week I&amp;#39;ve barely been sleeping, maybe 2 or 3 hours a night. I&amp;#39;m just afraid of her saying something more extreme this time like I&amp;#39;m drunk and have a gun, and the cops kicking my door in and ending my existance. But ALL evidence is on my google drive shared with my lawyer, my family, and an ex that I&amp;#39;m on really good terms with. I&amp;#39;ve instructed them if I do get jailed or SWAT&amp;#39;d over this, to sue everyone into oblivion and have provided so much documentation they&amp;#39;ll have a strong case.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My lawyer also finished with the cease and desist letter which I&amp;#39;m sending to the gremlins below today through certified mail. Then I&amp;#39;ll be pursuing symbolic damages via small claims court (sueing them for $5 for 5 different reasons, $1 a reason), then building a bigger law suit against them. I&amp;#39;ll also be attempting to work with the police to get a charge against them for false informing. I have promised myself and whatever entity is out there in this universe that I will make this woman desolate for trying to ruin my name, frame me for something I didn&amp;#39;t do, and potentially jail or have me harmed by police. If it&amp;#39;s the last fucking thing I do I will pursue this to the furthest realms civilly and lawfully. For now I am fully prepared to move if she does not move by the end of next week since management is not doing anything.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s pretty much the end of this update Reddit, I&amp;#39;m sure I&amp;#39;ll have some more news in a few weeks.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": true, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "e33231b4-23f8-11eb-9177-0ee49fa64465", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": true, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2yf7l", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#ff66ac", "id": "1kzverz", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "bjjkaril1", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 347, "send_replies": true, "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/neighborsfromhell/comments/1kzverz/update_neighbor_tried_to_ruin_my_life_and_send_me/", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/neighborsfromhell/comments/1kzverz/update_neighbor_tried_to_ruin_my_life_and_send_me/", "subreddit_subscribers": 183352, "created_utc": 1748692839.0, "num_crossposts": 1, "media": null, "is_video": false}}], "before": null}}}
