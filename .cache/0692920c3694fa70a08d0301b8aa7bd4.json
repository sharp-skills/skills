Most build tools should pick this up.  There's also a CJS artifact, and a second copy of the ESM file named `redux.legacy-esm.js` to support Webpack 4 (which does not recognize the `exports` field in `package.json`).  Additionally, all of the build artifacts now live under `./dist/` in the published package.\r\n\r\n#### Modernized Build Output\r\n\r\nWe now publish modern JS syntax targeting ES2020, including optional chaining, object spread, and other modern syntax. If you need to \r\n\r\n#### Build Tooling\r\n\r\nWe're now building the package using https://github.com/egoist/tsup. We also now include sourcemaps for the ESM and CJS artifacts.\r\n\r\n#### Dropping UMD Builds\r\n\r\nRedux has always shipped with UMD build artifacts.  These are primarily meant for direct import as script tags, such as in a CodePen or a no-bundler build environment.\r\n\r\nWe've dropped those build artifacts from the published package, on the grounds that the use cases seem pretty rare today.\r\n\r\nThere's now a `redux.browser.mjs` file in the package that can be loaded from a CDN like Unpkg.\r\n\r\nIf you have strong use cases for us continuing to include UMD build artifacts, please let us know!\r\n\r\n\r\n### `createStore` Marked Deprecated\r\n\r\nIn [Redux 4.2.0, we marked the original `createStore` method as `@deprecated`](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux/releases/tag/v4.2.0). Strictly speaking, **this is _not_ a breaking change**, nor is it new in 5.0, but we're documenting it here for completeness.\r\n\r\n**This deprecation is solely a _visual_ indicator that is meant to encourage users to [migrate their apps from legacy Redux patterns to use the modern Redux Toolkit APIs](https://redux.js.org/usage/migrating-to-modern-redux)**.\r\n\r\nThe deprecation results in a **visual strikethrough** when imported and used, like **~~`createStore`~~**, but with **_no_ runtime errors or warnings**.\r\n\r\n**`createStore` will continue to work indefinitely, and will _not_ ever be removed**. But, today we want _all_ Redux users to be using Redux Toolkit for all of their Redux logic.\r\n\r\nTo fix this, there are three options:\r\n\r\n- **[Follow our strong suggestion to switch over to Redux Toolkit and `configureStore`](https://redux.js.org/usage/migrating-to-modern-redux)**\r\n- Do nothing. It's just a visual strikethrough, and it doesn't affect how your code behaves. Ignore it.\r\n- Switch to using the `legacy_createStore` API that is now exported, which is the exact same function but with no `@deprecated` tag. The simplest option is to do an aliased import rename, like `import { legacy_createStore as createStore } from 'redux'`\r\n\r\n### Action types _must_ be strings\r\n\r\nWe've always specifically told our users that [actions and state _must_ be serializable](https://redux.js.org/style-guide/#do-not-put-non-serializable-values-in-state-or-actions), and that `action.type` _should_ be a string. This is both to ensure that actions are serializable, and to help provide a readable action history in the Redux DevTools.\r\n\r\n`store.dispatch(action)` now specifically enforces that **`action.type` _must_ be a string** and will throw an error if not, in the same way it throws an error if the action is not a plain object.\r\n\r\nIn practice, this was already true 99.99% of the time and shouldn't have any effect on users (especially those using Redux Toolkit and `createSlice`), but there may be some legacy Redux codebases that opted to use Symbols as action types.\r\n\r\n### TypeScript Changes\r\n\r\nWe've dropped support for TS 4.6 and earlier, and our support matrix is now TS 4.7+.\r\n\r\n#### Typescript rewrite\r\n\r\nIn 2019, we began a community-powered conversion of the Redux codebase to TypeScript. The original effort was discussed in [#3500: Port to TypeScript](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux/issues/3500), and the work was integrated in PR [#3536: Convert to TypeScript](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux/issues/3536).\r\n\r\nHowever, the TS-converted code sat around in the repo for several years, unused and unpublished, due to concerns about possible compatibility issues with the existing ecosystem (as well as general inertia on our part).\r\n\r\nRedux core v5 is now built from that TS-converted source code. In theory, this should be almost identical in both runtime behavior and types to the 4.x build, but it's very likely that some of the changes may cause types issues.\r\n\r\nPlease report any unexpected compatibility issues!!\r\n\r\n#### `AnyAction` deprecated in favour of `UnknownAction`\r\n\r\nThe Redux TS types have always exported an `AnyAction` type, which is defined to have `{type: string}` and treat any other field as `any`. This makes it easy to write uses like `console.log(action.whatever)`, but unfortunately does not provide any meaningful type safety.\r\n\r\nWe now export an `UnknownAction` type, which treats all fields other than `action.type` as `unknown`. This encourages users to write type guards that check the action object and assert its _specific_ TS type. Inside of those checks, you can access a field with better type safety.\r\n\r\n`UnknownAction` is now the default any place in the Redux source that expects an action object.\r\n\r\n`AnyAction` still exists for compatibility, but has been marked as deprecated.\r\n\r\nNote that [Redux Toolkit's action creators have a `.match()` method](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/api/createAction#actioncreatormatch) that acts as a useful type guard:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nif (todoAdded.match(someUnknownAction)) {\r\n  // action is now typed as a PayloadAction<Todo>\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can also use the new `isAction` util to check if an unknown value is some kind of action object.\r\n\r\n#### `Middleware` type changed - Middleware `action` and `next` are typed as `unknown`\r\n\r\nPreviously, the `next` parameter is typed as the `D` type parameter passed, and `action` is typed as the `Action` extracted from the dispatch type. Neither of these are a safe assumption:\r\n\r\n- `next` would be typed to have **all** of the dispatch extensions, including the ones earlier in the chain that would no longer apply.\r\n  - Technically it would be _mostly_ safe to type `next` as the default Dispatch implemented by the base redux store, however this would cause `next(action)` to error (as we cannot promise `action` is actually an `Action`) - and it wouldn't account for any following middlewares that return anything other than the action they're given when they see a specific action.\r\n- `action` is not necessarily a known action, it can be literally anything - for example a thunk would be a function with no `.type` property (so `AnyAction` would be inaccurate)\r\n\r\nWe've changed `next` to be `(action: unknown) => unknown` (which is accurate, we have no idea what `next` expects or will return), and changed the `action` parameter to be `unknown` (which as above, is accurate).\r\n\r\nIn order to safely interact with values or access fields inside of the `action` argument, you must first do a type guard check to narrow the type, such as `isAction(action)` or `someActionCreator.match(action)`.\r\n\r\nThis new type is incompatible with the v4 `Middleware` type, so if a package's middleware is saying it's incompatible, check which version of Redux it's getting its types from!\r\n\r\n#### `PreloadedState` type removed in favour of `Reducer` generic\r\n\r\nWe've made tweaks to the TS types to improve type safety and behavior.\r\n\r\nFirst, the `Reducer` type now has a `PreloadedState` possible generic:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\ntype Reducer<S, A extends Action, PreloadedState = S> = (\r\n  state: S | PreloadedState | undefined,\r\n  action: A\r\n) => S\r\n```\r\n\r\nPer the explanation in [#4491](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux/pull/4491):\r\n\r\nWhy the need for this change? When the store is first created by `createStore`/`configureStore`, the initial state is set to whatever is passed as the `preloadedState` argument (or `undefined` if nothing is passed). That means that the first time that the reducer is called, it is called with the `preloadedState`. After the first call, the reducer is always passed the current state (which is `S`).\r\n\r\nFor most normal reducers, `S | undefined` accurately describes what can be passed in for the `preloadedState`. However the `combineReducers` function allows for a preloaded state of `Partial<S> | undefined`.\r\n\r\nThe solution is to have a separate generic that represents what the reducer accepts for its preloaded state. That way `createStore` can then use that generic for its `preloadedState` argument.\r\n\r\nPreviously, this was handled by a `$CombinedState` type, but that complicated things and led to some user-reported issues. This removes the need for `$CombinedState` altogether.\r\n\r\nThis change does include some breaking changes, but overall should not have a huge impact on users upgrading in user-land:\r\n\r\n- The `Reducer`, `ReducersMapObject`, and `createStore`/`configureStore` types/function take an additional `PreloadedState` generic which defaults to `S`.\r\n- The overloads for `combineReducers` are removed in favor of a single function definition that takes the `ReducersMapObject` as its generic parameter. Removing the overloads was necessary with these changes, since sometimes it was choosing the wrong overload.\r\n- Enhancers that explicitly list the generics for the reducer will need to add the third generic.\r\n\r\n### Other Changes\r\n\r\n#### Internal Listener Implementation\r\n\r\nThe Redux store has always used an array to track listener callbacks, and used `listeners.findIndex` to remove listeners on unsubscribe.  As we found in React-Redux, that can have perf issues when many listeners are unsubscribing at once.\r\n\r\nIn React-Redux, we fixed that with a more sophisticated linked list approach.  Here, we've updated the `listeners` to be stored in a `Map` instead, which has better delete performance than an array.\r\n\r\nIn practice this shouldn't have any real effect, because React-Redux sets up a subscription in `<Provider>`, and all nested components subscribe to that.  But, nice to fix it here as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### `isAction` Predicate\r\n\r\nWe recently added an `isAction` predicate to RTK, then realized it's better suited for the Redux core.  This can be used anywhere you have a value that _could_ be a Redux action object, and you need to check if it is actually an action.  This is specifically useful for use with the updated Redux middleware TS types, where the default value is now `unknown` and you need to use a type guard to tell TS that the current value is actually an action:\r\n\r\nWe've also exported the `isPlainObject` util that's been in the Redux codebase for years as well.\r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n\r\nEntirely too many PRs to list here, as it's been a few years since  4.2 was released :)  See the diff below.\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/reduxjs/redux/compare/v4.2.1...v5.0.0", "discussion_url": "https://github.com/reduxjs/redux/discussions/4630", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/reduxjs/redux/releases/132440276/reactions", "total_count": 68, "+1": 12, "-1": 0, "laugh": 5, "hooray": 25, "confused": 0, "heart": 14, "rocket": 12, "eyes": 0}}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/reduxjs/redux/releases/131283095", "assets_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/reduxjs/redux/releases/131283095/assets", "upload_url": "https://uploads.github.com/repos/reduxjs/redux/releases/131283095/assets{?name,label}", "html_url": "https://github.com/reduxjs/redux/releases/tag/v5.0.0-rc.1", "id": 131283095, "author": {"login": "markerikson", "id": 1128784, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjExMjg3ODQ=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1128784?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/markerikson", "html_url": "https://github.com/markerikson", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/markerikson/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/markerikson/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/markerikson/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/markerikson/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/markerikson/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/markerikson/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/markerikson/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/markerikson/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/markerikson/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "node_id": "RE_kwDOAi17dM4H0ziX", "tag_name": "v5.0.0-rc.1", "target_commitish": "master", "name": "v5.0.0-rc.1", "draft": false, "immutable": false, "prerelease": true, "created_at": "2023-11-23T19:33:03Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-23T19:38:53Z", "published_at": "2023-11-23T19:38:53Z", "assets": [], "tarball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/reduxjs/redux/tarball/v5.0.0-rc.1", "zipball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/reduxjs/redux/zipball/v5.0.0-rc.1", "body": "This **release candidate** adds a new `isAction` predicate that can be used as a TS type guard, and exports the existing internal `isPlainObject` util.\r\n\r\n\r\nNote that **we hope to release Redux Toolkit 2.0, Redux core 5.0, and React-Redux 9.0 by the start of December!**  (If we don't hit that, we'll aim for January, after the holidays.)\r\n\r\nSee the preview **[Redux Toolkit 2.0 + Redux core 5.0 Migration Guide](https://deploy-preview-3089--redux-starter-kit-docs.netlify.app/migrations/migrating-1.x-to-2.x)** for an overview of breaking changes in RTK 2.0 and Redux core.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nnpm install redux@next\r\n\r\nyarn add redux@next\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n### `isAction` Predicate\r\n\r\nWe recently added an `isAction` predicate to RTK, then realized it's better suited for the Redux core.

types to add and use a new `UnknownAction` type where possible for better type safety, and includes all prior changes from the 5.0 alphas.  This release has **breaking changes** from 4.x.\r\n\r\nWe recommend that [users should prefer using Redux Toolkit for Redux development](https://redux.js.org/introduction/why-rtk-is-redux-today), and use [the RTK 2.0 beta that depends on this core release](), rather than using the Redux core library directly\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nnpm i redux@next\r\n\r\nyarn add redux@next\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\n### New `UnknownAction` Type\r\n\r\nThe Redux TS types have always exported an `AnyAction` type, which is defined to have `{type: string}` and treat any other field as `any`. This makes it easy to write uses like `console.log(action.whatever)`, but unfortunately does not provide any meaningful type safety.\r\n\r\nWe now export an `UnknownAction` type, which treats all fields other than `action.type` as `unknown`.  This encourages users to write type guards that check the action object and assert its _specific_ TS type.  Inside of those checks, you can access a field with better type safety.\r\n\r\n`UnknownAction` is now the default any place in the Redux source that expects an action object.\r\n\r\n`AnyAction` still exists for compatibility, but has been marked as deprecated.\r\n\r\nNote that [Redux Toolkit's action creators have a `.match()` method](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/api/createAction#actioncreatormatch) that acts as a useful type guard:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nif (todoAdded.match(someUnknownAction)) {\r\n  // action is now typed as a PayloadAction<Todo>\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Earlier Alpha Changes\r\n\r\nSummarizing changes from the earlier `5.0-alpha` releases:\r\n\r\n- Source code converted to TS\r\n- `createStore` deprecation tag ported\r\n- Removed `isMinified` check\r\n- Packaging converted to have full ESM/CJS compatibility\r\n- Dropped UMD build artifacts\r\n- JS build output is now \"modern\" and not transpiled for IE11 compatibility\r\n- Listener subscriptions are now a `Set`\r\n- Store enhancer types improved\r\n- `Reducer` type accepts a `PreloadedState` generic\r\n- Middleware `action` and `next` are typed as `unknown`\r\n- `action.type` field _must_ be a string\r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n\r\n* Prefer use of Action or UnknownAction instead of AnyAction by @EskiMojo14 in https://github.com/reduxjs/redux/pull/4520\r\n\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/reduxjs/redux/compare/v5.0.0-alpha.6...v5.0.0-beta.0", "discussion_url": "https://github.com/reduxjs/redux/discussions/4553", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/reduxjs/redux/releases/105443338/reactions", "total_count": 4, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 4}, "mentions_count": 1}]}
