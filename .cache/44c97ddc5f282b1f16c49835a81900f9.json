{"d": "**This GitHub repo (<https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy>) is the only official\nsource for the project. Do not download releases from random websites, even if\ntheir name contains `scrcpy`.**\n\n# scrcpy (v3.3.4)\n\n<img src=\"app/data/icon.svg\" width=\"128\" height=\"128\" alt=\"scrcpy\" align=\"right\" />\n\n_pronounced \"**scr**een **c**o**py**\"_\n\nThis application mirrors Android devices (video and audio) connected via USB or\n[TCP/IP](doc/connection.md#tcpip-wireless) and allows control using the\ncomputer's keyboard and mouse. It does not require _root_ access or an app\ninstalled on the device. It works on _Linux_, _Windows_, and _macOS_.\n\n![screenshot](assets/screenshot-debian-600.jpg)\n\nIt focuses on:\n\n - **lightness**: native, displays only the device screen\n - **performance**: 30~120fps, depending on the device\n - **quality**: 1920\u00d71080 or above\n - **low latency**: [35~70ms][lowlatency]\n - **low startup time**: ~1 second to display the first image\n - **non-intrusiveness**: nothing is left installed on the Android device\n - **user benefits**: no account, no ads, no internet required\n - **freedom**: free and open source software\n\n[lowlatency]: https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy/pull/646\n\nIts features include:\n - [audio forwarding](doc/audio.md) (Android 11+)\n - [recording](doc/recording.md)\n - [virtual display](doc/virtual_display.md)\n - mirroring with [Android device screen off](doc/device.md#turn-screen-off)\n - [copy-paste](doc/control.md#copy-paste) in both directions\n - [configurable quality](doc/video.md)\n - [camera mirroring](doc/camera.md) (Android 12+)\n - [mirroring as a webcam (V4L2)](doc/v4l2.md) (Linux-only)\n - physical [keyboard][hid-keyboard] and [mouse][hid-mouse] simulation (HID)\n - [gamepad](doc/gamepad.md) support\n - [OTG mode](doc/otg.md)\n - and more\u2026\n\n[hid-keyboard]: doc/keyboard.md#physical-keyboard-simulation\n[hid-mouse]: doc/mouse.md#physical-mouse-simulation\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nThe Android device requires at least API 21 (Android 5.0).\n\n[Audio forwarding](doc/audio.md) is supported for API >= 30 (Android 11+).\n\nMake sure you [enabled USB debugging][enable-adb] on your device(s).\n\n[enable-adb]: https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options#enable\n\nOn some devices (especially Xiaomi), you might get the following error:\n\n```\nInjecting input events requires the caller (or the source of the instrumentation, if any) to have the INJECT_EVENTS permission.\n```\n\nIn that case, you need to enable [an additional option][control] `USB debugging\n(Security Settings)` (this is an item different from `USB debugging`) to control\nit using a keyboard and mouse. Rebooting the device is necessary once this\noption is set.\n\n[control]: https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy/issues/70#issuecomment-373286323\n\nNote that USB debugging is not required to run scrcpy in [OTG mode](doc/otg.md).\n\n\n## Get the app\n\n - [Linux](doc/linux.md)\n - [Windows](doc/windows.md) (read [how to run](doc/windows.md#run))\n - [macOS](doc/macos.md)\n\n\n## Must-know tips\n\n - [Reducing resolution](doc/video.md#size) may greatly improve performance\n   (`scrcpy -m1024`)\n - [_Right-click_](doc/mouse.md#mouse-bindings) triggers `BACK`\n - [_Middle-click_](doc/mouse.md#mouse-bindings) triggers `HOME`\n - <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>f</kbd> toggles [fullscreen](doc/window.md#fullscreen)\n - There are many other [shortcuts](doc/shortcuts.md)\n\n\n## Usage examples\n\nThere are a lot of options, [documented](#user-documentation) in separate pages.\nHere are just some common examples.\n\n - Capture the screen in H.265 (better quality), limit the size to 1920, limit\n   the frame rate to 60fps, disable audio, and control the device by simulating\n   a physical keyboard:\n\n    ```bash\n    scrcpy --video-codec=h265 --max-size=1920 --max-fps=60 --no-audio --keyboard=uhid\n    scrcpy --video-codec=h265 -m1920 --max-fps=60 --no-audio -K  # short version\n    ```\n\n - Start VLC in a new virtual display (separate from the device display):\n\n    ```bash\n    scrcpy --new-display=1920x1080 --start-app=org.videolan.vlc\n    ```\n\n - Record the device camera in H.265 at 1920x1080 (and microphone) to an MP4\n   file:\n\n    ```bash\n    scrcpy --video-source=camera --video-codec=h265 --camera-size=1920x1080 --record=file.mp4\n    ```\n\n - Capture the device front camera and expose it as a webcam on the computer (on\n   Linux):\n\n    ```bash\n    scrcpy --video-source=camera --camera-size=1920x1080 --camera-facing=front --v4l2-sink=/dev/video2 --no-playback\n    ```\n\n - Control the device without mirroring by simulating a physical keyboard and\n   mouse (USB debugging not required):\n\n    ```bash\n    scrcpy --otg\n    ```\n\n - Control the device using gamepad controllers plugged into the computer:\n\n    ```bash\n    scrcpy --gamepad=uhid\n    scrcpy -G  # short version\n    ```\n\n## User documentation\n\nThe application provides a lot of features and configuration options.
