Pick one and start your hands-on experience with Pathway today!\n\n### Event processing and real-time analytics pipelines\nWith its unified engine for batch and streaming and its full Python compatibility, Pathway makes data processing as easy as possible. It's the ideal solution for a wide range of data processing pipelines, including:\n\n- [Showcase: Real-time ETL.](https://pathway.com/developers/templates/kafka-etl)\n- [Showcase: Event-driven pipelines with alerting.](https://pathway.com/developers/templates/realtime-log-monitoring)\n- [Showcase: Realtime analytics.](https://pathway.com/developers/templates/linear_regression_with_kafka)\n- [Docs: Switch from batch to streaming.](https://pathway.com/developers/user-guide/connecting-to-data/switch-from-batch-to-streaming)\n\n\n\n### AI Pipelines\n\nPathway provides dedicated LLM tooling to build live LLM and RAG pipelines. Wrappers for most common LLM services and utilities are included, making working with LLMs and RAGs pipelines incredibly easy. Check out our [LLM xpack documentation](https://pathway.com/developers/user-guide/llm-xpack/overview).\n\nDon't hesitate to try one of our runnable examples featuring LLM tooling.\nYou can find such examples [here](https://pathway.com/developers/user-guide/llm-xpack/llm-examples).\n\n  - [Template: Unstructured data to SQL on-the-fly.](https://pathway.com/developers/templates/unstructured-to-structured)\n  - [Template: Private RAG with Ollama and Mistral AI](https://pathway.com/developers/templates/private-rag-ollama-mistral)\n  - [Template: Adaptive RAG](https://pathway.com/developers/templates/adaptive-rag)\n  - [Template: Multimodal RAG with gpt-4o](https://pathway.com/developers/templates/multimodal-rag)\n\n## Features\n\n- **A wide range of connectors**: Pathway comes with connectors that connect to external data sources such as Kafka, GDrive, PostgreSQL, or SharePoint. Its Airbyte connector allows you to connect to more than 300 different data sources. If the connector you want is not available, you can build your own custom connector using Pathway Python connector.\n- **Stateless and stateful transformations**: Pathway supports stateful transformations such as joins, windowing, and sorting. It provides many transformations directly implemented in Rust. In addition to the provided transformation, you can use any Python function. You can implement your own or you can use any Python library to process your data.\n- **Persistence**: Pathway provides persistence to save the state of the computation. This allows you to restart your pipeline after an update or a crash. Your pipelines are in good hands with Pathway!\n- **Consistency**: Pathway handles the time for you, making sure all your computations are consistent. In particular, Pathway manages late and out-of-order points by updating its results whenever new (or late, in this case) data points come into the system. The free version of Pathway gives the \"at least once\" consistency while the enterprise version provides the \"exactly once\" consistency.\n- **Scalable Rust engine**: with Pathway Rust engine, you are free from the usual limits imposed by Python. You can easily do multithreading, multiprocessing, and distributed computations.\n- **LLM helpers**: Pathway provides an LLM extension with all the utilities to integrate LLMs with your data pipelines (LLM wrappers, parsers, embedders, splitters), including an in-memory real-time Vector Index, and integrations with LLamaIndex and LangChain. You can quickly build and deploy RAG applications with your live documents.\n\n\n## Getting started<a id=\"getting-started\"></a>\n\n### Installation<a id=\"installation\"></a>\n\nPathway requires Python 3.10 or above.\n\nYou can install the current release of Pathway using `pip`:\n\n```\n$ pip install -U pathway\n```\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f Pathway is available on MacOS and Linux. Users of other systems should run Pathway on a Virtual Machine.\n\n\n### Example: computing the sum of positive values in real time.<a id=\"example\"></a>\n\n```python\nimport pathway as pw\n\n# Define the schema of your data (Optional)\nclass InputSchema(pw.Schema):\n  value: int\n\n# Connect to your data using connectors\ninput_table = pw.io.csv.read(\n  \"./input/\",\n  schema=InputSchema\n)\n\n#Define your operations on the data\nfiltered_table = input_table.filter(input_table.value>=0)\nresult_table = filtered_table.reduce(\n  sum_value = pw.reducers.sum(filtered_table.value)\n)\n\n# Load your results to external systems\npw.io.jsonlines.write(result_table, \"output.jsonl\")\n\n# Run the computation\npw.run()\n```\n\nRun Pathway [in Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1aBIJ2HCng-YEUOMrr0qtj0NeZMEyRz55?usp=sharing).\n\nYou can find more examples [here](https://github.com/pathwaycom/pathway/tree/main/examples).\n\n\n## Deployment<a id=\"deployment\"></a>\n\n### Locally<a id=\"running-pathway-locally\"></a>\n\nTo use Pathway, you only need to import it:\n\n```python\nimport pathway as pw\n```\n\nNow, you can easily create your processing pipeline, and let Pathway handle the updates. Once your pipeline is created, you can launch the computation on streaming data with a one-line command:\n\n```python\npw.run()\n```\n\nYou can then run your Pathway project (say, `main.py`) just like a normal Python script: `$ python main.py`.\nPathway comes with a monitoring dashboard that allows you to keep track of the number of messages sent by each connector and the latency of the system. The dashboard also includes log messages. \n\n<img src=\"https://d14l3brkh44201.cloudfront.net/pathway-dashboard.png\" width=\"1326\" alt=\"Pathway dashboard\"/>\n\nAlternatively, you can use the pathway'ish version:\n\n```\n$ pathway spawn python main.py\n```\n\nPathway natively supports multithreading.\nTo launch your application with 3 threads, you can do as follows:\n```\n$ pathway spawn --threads 3 python main.py\n```\n\nTo jumpstart a Pathway project, you can use our [cookiecutter template](https://github.com/pathwaycom/cookiecutter-pathway).\n\n\n### Docker<a id=\"docker\"></a>\n\nYou can easily run Pathway using docker.\n\n#### Pathway image\n\nYou can use the [Pathway docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/pathwaycom/pathway), using a Dockerfile:\n\n```dockerfile\nFROM pathwaycom/pathway:latest\n\nWORKDIR /app\n\nCOPY requirements.txt ./\nRUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt\n\nCOPY . .\n\nCMD [ \"python\", \"./your-script.py\" ]\n```\n\nYou can then build and run the Docker image:\n\n```console\ndocker build -t my-pathway-app .\ndocker run -it --rm --name my-pathway-app my-pathway-app\n```\n\n#### Run a single Python script\n\nWhen dealing with single-file projects, creating a full-fledged `Dockerfile`\nmight seem unnecessary. In such scenarios, you can execute a\nPython script directly using the Pathway Docker image. For example:\n\n```console\ndocker run -it --rm --name my-pathway-app -v \"$PWD\":/app pathwaycom/pathway:latest python my-pathway-app.py\n```\n\n#### Python docker image\n\nYou can also use a standard Python image and install Pathway using pip with a Dockerfile:\n\n```dockerfile\nFROM --platform=linux/x86_64 python:3.10\n\nRUN pip install -U pathway\nCOPY ./pathway-script.py pathway-script.py\n\nCMD [\"python\", \"-u\", \"pathway-script.py\"]\n```\n\n### Kubernetes and cloud<a id=\"k8s\"></a>\n\nDocker containers are ideally suited for deployment on the cloud with Kubernetes.\nIf you want to scale your Pathway application, you may be interested in our Pathway for Enterprise.\nPathway for Enterprise is specially tailored towards end-to-end data processing and real time intelligent analytics.\nIt scales using distributed computing on the cloud and supports distributed Kubernetes deployment, with external persistence setup.\n\nYou can easily deploy Pathway using services like Render: see [how to deploy Pathway in a few clicks](https://pathway.com/developers/user-guide/deployment/render-deploy/).\n\nIf you are interested, don't hesitate to [contact us](mailto:contact@pathway.com) to learn more.\n\n## Performance<a id=\"performance\"></a>\n\nPathway is made to outperform state-of-the-art technologies designed for streaming and batch data processing tasks, including: Flink, Spark, and Kafka Streaming. It also makes it possible to implement a lot of algorithms/UDF's in streaming mode which are not readily supported by other streaming frameworks (especially: temporal joins, iterative graph algorithms, machine learning routines).\n\nIf you are curious, here are [some benchmarks to play with](https://github.com/pathwaycom/pathway-benchmarks).\n\n<img src=\"https://github.com/pathwaycom/pathway-benchmarks/raw/main/images/bm-wordcount-lineplot.png\" width=\"1326\" alt=\"WordCount Graph\"/>\n\n## Documentation and Support<a id=\"resources\"></a>\n\nThe entire documentation of Pathway is available at [pathway.com/developers/](https://pathway.com/developers/user-guide/introduction/welcome), including the [API Docs](https://pathway.com/developers/api-docs/pathway).\n\nIf you have any question, don't hesitate to [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/pathwaycom/pathway/issues), join us on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/pathway), or send us an email at [contact@pathway.com](mailto:contact@pathway.com).\n\n\n\n## \ud83e\udd1d Featured Collaborations & Integrations\n\nWe build cutting-edge data processing pipelines and co-promote solutions that push the boundaries of what's possible with Python and streaming data.\nMeet the people helping us shape the future of data engineering.\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n\n| Project | Description |\n| ------------ | ----------- |\n| [Databento](https://databento.com/blog/option-greeks) | A simpler, faster way to get market data. |\n| [LangChain](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/integrations/vectorstores/pathway) | LangChain is the platform for agent engineering. |\n| [LlamaIndex](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/retrievers/pathway_retriever/) | The developer-trusted framework for building context-aware AI agents. |\n| [MinIO](https://www.min.io/) | MinIO is a high-performance, S3 compatible object store, open sourced under GNU AGPLv3 license. |\n| [PaddleOCR](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleOCR) | PaddleOCR is an industry-leading, production-ready OCR and document AI engine, offering end-to-end solutions from text extraction to intelligent document understanding. |\n| [Redpanda](https://www.redpanda.com/blog/replace-kafka-redpanda-data-analysis-streaming) | Build, operate, and govern streaming and AI applications without the complexity of Kafka. |\n</div>\n\n\n## License<a id=\"license\"></a>\n\nPathway is distributed on a [BSL 1.1 License](https://github.com/pathwaycom/pathway/blob/main/LICENSE.txt) which allows for unlimited non-commercial use, as well as use of the Pathway package [for most commercial purposes](https://pathway.com/license/), free of charge.
