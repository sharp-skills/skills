restoring any built-in models that were overridden, without requiring `/reload` ([docs](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/blob/main/packages/coding-agent/docs/custom-provider.md)).\n- `pi.registerProvider()` now takes effect immediately when called outside the initial extension load phase (e.g. from a command handler), removing the need for `/reload` after late registrations.\n\n### Added\n\n- `pi.unregisterProvider(name)` removes a dynamically registered provider and its models from the registry without requiring `/reload`. Built-in models that were overridden by the provider are restored ([#1669](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1669) by [@aliou](https://github.com/aliou)).\n\n### Fixed\n\n- `pi.registerProvider()` now takes effect immediately when called after the initial extension load phase (e.g. from a command handler). Previously the registration sat in a pending queue that was never flushed until the next `/reload` ([#1669](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1669) by [@aliou](https://github.com/aliou)).\n- Fixed duplicate session headers when forking from a point before any assistant message. `createBranchedSession` now defers file creation to `_persist()` when the branched path has no assistant message, matching the `newSession()` contract ([#1672](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1672) by [@w-winter](https://github.com/w-winter)).\n- Fixed SIGINT being delivered to pi while the process is suspended (e.g. via `ctrl+z`), which could corrupt terminal state on resume ([#1668](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1668) by [@aliou](https://github.com/aliou)).\n- Fixed Z.ai thinking control using wrong parameter name, causing thinking to always be enabled and wasting tokens/latency ([#1674](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1674) by [@okuyam2y](https://github.com/okuyam2y))\n- Fixed `redacted_thinking` blocks being silently dropped during Anthropic streaming, and related issues with interleaved-thinking beta headers and temperature being sent alongside extended thinking ([#1665](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1665) by [@tctev](https://github.com/tctev))\n- Fixed `(external, cli)` user-agent flag causing 401 errors on Anthropic setup-token endpoint ([#1677](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1677) by [@LazerLance777](https://github.com/LazerLance777))\n- Fixed crash when OpenAI-compatible provider returns a chunk with no `choices` array ([#1671](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1671))\n\n"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/badlogic/pi-mono/releases/290641801", "assets_url":

([#1599](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1599) by [@audichuang](https://github.com/audichuang)).\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Fixed offline startup hangs by adding offline startup behavior and network timeouts during managed tool setup ([#1631](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1631) by [@mcollina](https://github.com/mcollina))\n- Fixed Windows VT input initialization in ESM by loading koffi via createRequire, avoiding runtime and bundling issues in end-user environments ([#1627](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1627) by [@kaste](https://github.com/kaste))\n- Fixed managed `fd`/`rg` bootstrap on Windows in Git Bash by using `extract-zip` for `.zip` archives, searching extracted layouts more robustly, and isolating extraction temp directories to avoid concurrent download races ([#1348](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1348))\n- Fixed extension loading on Windows when resolving `@sinclair/typebox` aliases so subpath imports like `@sinclair/typebox/compiler` resolve correctly.\n- Fixed adaptive thinking for Claude Sonnet 4.6 in Anthropic and Bedrock providers, and clamped unsupported `xhigh` effort values to supported levels ([#1548](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1548) by [@tctev](https://github.com/tctev))\n- Fixed Vertex ADC credential detection race by avoiding caching a false negative during async import initialization ([#1550](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1550) by [@jeremiahgaylord-web](https://github.com/jeremiahgaylord-web))\n- Fixed subagent extension example to resolve user agents

The folder is now only created when writing project-specific settings.\n- Fixed extension-driven runtime theme changes to persist in settings so `/settings` reflects the active `currentTheme` after `ctx.ui.setTheme(...)` ([#1483](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1483) by [@ferologics](https://github.com/ferologics))\n- Fixed interactive mode freezes during large streaming `write` tool calls by using incremental syntax highlighting while partial arguments stream, with a final full re-highlight after tool-call arguments complete.\n\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/badlogic/pi-mono/releases/289220691/reactions", "total_count": 2, "+1": 2, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}}]}
