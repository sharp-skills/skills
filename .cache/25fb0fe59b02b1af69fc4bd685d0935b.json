But in this moment, as the only blood-related woman on my father\u2019s side of the family it\u00a0*feels*\u00a0gendered. Idk, maybe I\u2019m wrong.\n\nA few days ago my dad came over to my house for the first time in quite a while. I\u2019ve had a lot of renovations done since he last saw the place when we first moved in. I have a nervous system condition which, while very fortunate to be able to manage it in such a way that it\u00a0*usually*\u00a0doesn\u2019t impact my life\u00a0*most days out of any given month*, can render certain simple tasks very difficult for me when I\u2019m having a flare. It\u2019s also important -as part of managing my condition and maintaining my high level of function- to limit certain activities which can bring about a crash or a flare. My husband is also disabled -he has hypermobile eds- so together we made a list of things we\u2019d love to have as accommodations in the home we share and we either DIYed those things or found contractors to do them for us.\n\nI\u2019m really happy with the results. I find that these accommodating renovations make my life a lot easier, I have fewer crashes, and overall more energy. My husband is ELATED with how much more functional he can be after we made these changes.\n\nMy father isn\u2019t a fan. He thinks it all makes the house \u201ctoo weird\u201d. He\u2019s worried about the resell value (not that we\u2019re planning to sell anytime soon??). He had a lot of comments when he came over, in fact it was almost all he talked about. I kept trying to gently tell him that this is just what works for us and then divert the subject but he was getting a bit worked up which isn\u2019t really like him in those types of situations.\n\nThe plan for his visit was he\u2019d come over, meet my foster dog that he might adopt, and take the dogs for a walk then get lunch. When I left him alone for a minute to go use the bathroom after we\u2019d walked the dogs, I came back out and found that he\u2019d attempted to pull one of our accommodating mechanisms out of the kitchen wall. He hadn\u2019t caused any functional damage but he did cause aesthetic damage in that it will now need to be repainted over.\n\nI was shocked and kind of hysterical in my reaction and I raised my voice at him when I saw what he was doing. I think I yelled \u201cwhat the fuck are you doing, dad?? What\u2019s your problem?!\u201d and he responded \u201cI just wanted to see if it was removable! Sorry! it\u2019s just too weird! It\u2019s too weird it\u2019s just not going to work when Billy and Bobby move in with you\u201d.\n\n\u201cBilly and Bobby\u201d are my nephews. My brother\u2019s kids. I have never invited them to stay with me -let alone MOVE IN- for any amount of time, and I\u2019ve never been asked to do so. Even in the event that my brother and sister in law passed away in some tragic manner; to my knowledge I should be very far down a VERY long list of people who could be asked to take those kids in before I would be asked.\n\nSo, I was pretty shocked my dad would say something like that out of the blue (and with so much frustrated emotion) about Billy and Bobby \u201cmoving in\u201d because there\u2019s no reason -to my knowledge- for anyone to think that would possibly be happening. I asked him to clarify repeatedly but he just waved it off and told me to forget he said anything and he didn\u2019t want to talk about it. I pressed him and all he said was \u201cwell, honey, it\u2019s a massive house! You have room for two boys!\u201d. When I asked him why he would even bring it up though, and clarified that not only did I have absolutely no desire to host my nephews for a visit let alone to \u201cmove them in\u201d he clammed up again and just said \u201cforget I ever said anything\u201d. He apologized for damaging my home, immediately transferred a larger sum than necessary to me via Zelle to fix the scratch he\u2019d made and then took me out to lunch as we planned prior.\n\nThe rest of the day with him was pretty normal and I guess I was just a little shocked or something because I didn\u2019t bring it up again. But now that it\u2019s been a few days I can\u2019t get it out of my head and I\u2019m so annoyed.\n\nFirst of all, my dad hasn\u2019t ever been and would NEVER be that aggressive about any decoration or renovation in my brother\u2019s homes. He just wouldn\u2019t. And I can\u2019t help but feel that he is less respectful of my home because I\u2019m a woman. Which sucks.\n\nBut more upsetting/confusing\u2026.what the fuck was he talking about in terms of my nephews??? Like, is my family conspiring in some way to move those kids in with me? It wouldn\u2019t be the first time that my family assumed I\u2019d take care of those kids without asking me first but in the past it was just babysitting and I have directly told EVERYONE that even\u00a0*that*\u00a0is unacceptable, so I would be really shocked if my brother/sil thought that was acceptable.\n\nI guess I\u2019m just spinning out and don\u2019t really know what to do about it. I\u2019m stuck between asking my father about it again first or just reaching out to my brother directly.\n\n***Some of OOP's Comments:***\n\n**one\\_bean\\_hahahaha:** Is there something wrong with your brother that he can't raise his own kids?\n\n&gt;**OOP:**\u00a0No, nothing wrong. To my knowledge my brother isn\u2019t looking to move his kids out of his own home either.  \nThey are sometimes difficult kids. A little delayed and a lot entitled/enabled. In the past they\u2019ve leaned heavily on family for childcare since my brother has a demanding job and my sil has a hard time being alone with her kids. When I lived with my dad I was a big part of that equation and ended up being more responsible for those kids then I\u2019d have agreed to, because I wasn\u2019t in control of telling them if they could bring the kids over as it was my father\u2019s house. But even when I still lived with my dad I was able to establish some boundaries and assert that I wouldn\u2019t agree to care for them on demand, and that was generally respected after I put my foot down a few times.\n\n**Hawkson2020:** I\u2019d definitely try to get more info from your dad, but failing that it wouldn\u2019t be bad to talk to your brother? It seems like a really out of pocket thing to say unless he has some serious information you don\u2019t.\n\n&gt;**OOP:**\u00a0It\u2019s incredibly out of pocket.  \nNot only do I not want those kids to live with me, but I also would assume that my brother wouldn\u2019t want his kids to live with me. There are a million reasons why, but chiefly it wouldn\u2019t be a good idea safety-wise for those kids!  \nI\u2019ve been dealing with a stalker for years who has already threatened me that she would harm my nephews, at which point I distanced myself from Billy and Bobby (stopped picking them up from school etc) and the threats directed at them stopped.  \nCurrently I\u2019m working on taking legal action but nothing is set in stone and even the idea of those kids -who are difficult but who I also love very much- being in my home makes me worried that they would be directly targeted or that there would be some escalation.  \nI actually can\u2019t imagine that my family would think it\u2019s a good idea to move those kids in with me. Like, I can\u2019t imagine circumstances where that would seem appropriate\n\n**Hawkson2020:** Yeah, particularly given that information (but even without it) it\u2019s hard to imagine your brother or sil would want or expect you to take in their kids short of some kind of serious health or relationship emergency.\n\nAnd even then, that wouldn\u2019t be something for your dad to be concerned about unless he\u2019s a particularly worrying person.\n\n&gt;**OOP:**\u00a0Even if there\u2019s an emergency, I simply cannot be the first person on their list to take those kids in. I\u2019m the only younger female blood relative I guess but there are SO many other relatives and family friends who need to come before me on that list. My brother and SIL have a MASSIVE village, so I\u2019m talking DOZENS. It\u2019s baffling to me that it would come down to me to take those kids in under any circumstances\n\n**Brattius:** The fact that he was actively trying to tear your house apart is a Hugh red flag. My bet is your brother is getting a divorce and they were just going to 'dump' then on you since his job is so demanding\n\n&gt;**OOP:**\u00a0Honestly\u2026.I feel like a fucking idiot that the two of them getting divorced hadn\u2019t even crossed my mind\u2026.  \nNot that they have an actively bad marriage or anything, but I think their dynamic is weird and I guess I wouldn\u2019t be shocked.  \nThank you for this insight.  \nI mean, either way it\u2019s a no from me for various reasons.\n\n**Puzzleheaded-Ad7606:** BETTER YET: Group text to them- Guys, I'm worried about Dad. He came over the other day and kinda flipped out about our disability accomations and tried to rip one off the wall. Then he thought Billy and Bobby where coming to live here, but couldn't explain why. I'm worried, has anyone else noticed strange, aggressive behavior?\n\n&gt;**OOP:**\u00a0I think I\u2019ll go with this, but on a call. I want to hear a response in real time. My dad has normalized triangulation a bit too much in this family for my comfort\n\n*Example of triangulation:*\n\n&gt;Dad will say \u201cyour brother is REALLY upset that you said you can\u2019t go to his birthday dinner he EVEN said he\u2019ll move it up an hour just so you can come and I know that you\u2019d still need to move your schedule around even if it\u2019s an hour earlier but he REALLY wants to make it easier for you because he REALLY wants you there!\u201d when my brother said neither of those things.  \nThen he\u2019ll tell my brother \u201cyour sister is HEART BROKEN that she can\u2019t make it to your party and she doesn\u2019t want to say anything but she\u2019s hurt that you aren\u2019t having it an hour earlier so she can make it!\u201d When I said neither of those things.  \nAnd he does all this because he wants the whole family at my brothers party and doesn\u2019t like the idea of the whole family not being present. So my brother moves his party up an hour because he thinks that\u2019s what I said I wanted, I move my schedule around to go to his party because that\u2019s what I think he wanted. And both of us feel kind of weird and resentful and strange and neither of us find out that we got played until we casually talk about the incident ten years later\n\n**IAmMelonLord:** How old is your dad? Could he be having a sort of mental episode that he thinks your nephews are supposed to move in with you? Barring that, I\u2019d ask your brother \u201chey, do you have any idea why dad would say this? Is something going on?\u201d\n\n&gt;**OOP:**\u00a0He\u2019s in his 70\u2019s but he\u2019s still sharp enough to be working. I asked my other brother (nebulously without mentioning the reason why) who works with my dad every day if he\u2019d noticed any decline and he said dad seems sharp as ever in their work environment. It\u2019s pretty mentally demanding work so I think it would be evident there.  \nI\u2019ll also note though, my dad \u201crejected\u201d an OCD diagnosis when he was in therapy after my parents divorce. So he\u2019s not without any history of mental illness\u2026.not sure if that would cause this behavior though.\n\n**QueenMEB120:** If this is a new development, it may be a UTI. The symptoms of an undiagnosed UTI can mimic early stage dementia. And UTI's can have no physical symptoms, like burning or pain during urination, in the early stages. Look up Silent UTI's.\n\n&gt;**OOP:**\u00a0Oh shit! Dad has gotten several UTIs before! Just googled it and I had no clue that they could be \u201csilent\u201d or that they could impact cognition!!!\n\n**Selsia6:** Is your dad OK with your and your husband's disabilities? It sounds abelist, like he was trying to remove the reminder of your disability and then came up with a nonsensical excuse after the fact.\n\n&gt;**OOP:**\u00a0My dad is in utter denial that I\u2019m disabled. He only briefly accepted when my symptoms were severe and I couldn\u2019t work, but after I started my own business he\u2019s basically just been totally averse to the idea that I need to manage my symptoms and thinks I\u2019m being dramatic.\n\n*People ask several questions about the stalker OOP mentioned in one of the comments:*\n\n&gt;It\u2019s ok. She\u2019s someone I used to be friends with and honestly it\u2019s my bad because I hung in there even when I realized she was becoming mentally unstable.  \nShe became fixated on my husband when he and I began dating and I became the enemy in her eyes.  \n*On if dad takes the stalking seriously:*  \nNo, he does actually take her seriously, This woman has stalked him too and done property damage to his house.\n\n**Update (Same Post): May 2, 2025 (Next Day)**\n\nI talked to my brother on the phone about the situation and he expressed that he had absolutely no idea why our father would imply that Billy and Bobby would need to move in with me at any point. He seemed genuinely surprised and to have no clue what the hell dad was talking about. He claims to have absolutely never expressed anything like that to our dad. I believe him.\n\nI asked him if there was any possible reason\u00a0*at all*\u00a0that dad would think that I\u2019d need to take in my nephews. Like is there some problem dad thinks he is pre-solving without consulting either of us? Is there an illness or impending divorce or ANYTHING I don\u2019t know about? My brother assured me that there\u2019s nothing like that going on and that -as I assumed- I, of course, wouldn\u2019t even be near the top of the list of permanent caregivers even if something WAS going on because he knows I run two businesses out of my house and also just am not up for taking his kids in unless I am the absolute last safe resort.\n\nBoth of us are in agreement (as is our other oldest brother) that dad generally doesn\u2019t seem to have any other signs that we\u2019ve noticed of declining cognitive function\u2026.like at all. But since this was such a strange outburst we\u2019re still concerned that this is just the earliest sign. My brother -Billy and Bobby\u2019s dad- is going to talk to our dad about it asap and see what he says or what explanation he can give, then we\u2019ll go from there.\n\nThe issue that we\u2019re both aware of is that my dad, while a loving father and good man to many, is a bit of a liar and a lot of a manipulator. He has a lot of signs of OCD and gets fixated on things, then tries to manipulate to get his way with his fixation. He means well, but he has been known to be full of shit and to have his own strange agendas that don\u2019t have much to do with anyone else\u2019s wants or needs. So unfortunately my brother and I (and my brother has volunteered to go first lol) are going to have to confront him by essentially saying \u201cdad, it\u2019s really important that you\u2019re honest about wether you are\u00a0*confused*\u00a0or intentionally lying/triangulating/manipulating because that\u2019s the difference between us freaking out about your health vs us just understanding that sometimes you lie to push your agenda but your brain is fine\u201d.\n\nThank you to everyone who gave me feedback here! You\u2019ve all been so sweet and supportive except that one guy who for some reason was dead convinced that I didn\u2019t pay for my own home and commented several times and DMed me about it (I did pay for my home, and it\u2019s solely in my name\u2026.you weirdo).\n\nI\u2019ll keep y\u2019all updated on what my brother and I figure out going forward!\n\n# New Update\n\n**\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1q9bius/update_on_dad_hating_my_houseexpecting_me_to_take/)**: January 10, 2026 (8 months later)\\*\\*\\*\\*\\***\n\nI know this was forever ago, but life has been lifing pretty hard since then.\n\nThe og post and first update which I made at the top of the original are in my post history.\n\nFirst of all I just want to thank everyone for your concern and overall support. This sub is full of such lovely and helpful people. So many of you left tremendously helpful comments and sent me such kind messages as well.\n\nSo I guess I\u2019ll start by saying that my dad doesn\u2019t have dementia or Alzheimer\u2019s or anything like that. If\u00a0*anything*\u00a0he is perhaps experiencing a very slight cognitive decline due to age, but only insofar as his typical lifelong nonsense becoming a little more pronounced and he\u2019s not really as slick as he thinks he is or as good at manipulating as he\u2019s used to being. Basically, he\u2019s used to being able to get away with a lot more manipulation of his kids than he\u2019s able to get away with now. I don\u2019t even think the onus for this particular episode of his is directly an age thing at all though, I think it\u2019s a situational thing.\n\nAfter I talked to my dad multiple times, conferred with my brothers after they talked to my dad multiple times and after we basically had to tell our father \u201chey, if you\u2019re not totally upfront about what\u2019s going on we have to assume that you need to see a doctor and we\u2019re NOT just going to drop this like we usually drop uncomfortable things in this family\u201d\u2026I think I have figured out what was up:\n\nEver since I moved out of my father\u2019s house -leaving an empty bedroom and office space in a house that ALREADY had a designated bedroom for the kids because they had a lot sleepovers there- my sister in law has been obsessively pushing the idea that my nephews should start living summers and school breaks at my dad\u2019s house. I knew she\u2019d brought this up a few times but I didn\u2019t know how adamant she was being because this push entirely took place after I had moved. My dad doesn\u2019t live far from my brother and SIL\u2019s place (15 minutes away) so it\u2019s not like they\u2019d be having some special summer experience in a new location\u2026I think she just wants them out of her house for the summer lol\u2026\n\nMy nephews LOVE staying at grandpas because my dad has never been a real caregiver (not even when we were kids) so there are literally no rules, no bedtimes, no limit on sweets, no parental controls on the tv, no limit on screen times, no one checking if they brushed their teeth or making them shower or do chores or change their clothes, zero supervision over them making messes or doing dumb shit etc. So of course when their mom asked them \u201cdo you want to spend the summer at grandpas?! Do you want to go ask grandpa if he\u2019ll let you stay the summer with him???\u201d they went feral over the idea and my dad was immediately put in the position of either agreeing or disappointing his two grandkids and saying no. My dad hates saying no to family outright, because he NEVER wants family to say no to him at all. So he agreed, of course.\n\nMy dad agreed to this last summer, But even with the help of a daily babysitter (who apparently quit halfway through, and I assume it\u2019s either because my dad made her uncomfortable-which is a whole different kettle of fish-, or because those kids are SUPER entitled), and even though the kids are getting more and more independent, it was torturous and exhausting for him. He never wanted to do that again.\n\nBut (and my dad didn\u2019t say this, this is me applying what I know about him in general) my father is addicted to being the hero of the family. He needs us all to need him and he needs us all to think he\u2019s great. PLUS he has a massive ego about defying the idea of aging and being ultra energetic and healthy etc, and not \u201can old man\u201d. He could not bring himself to admit that he doesn\u2019t have the energy for those kids, and he didn\u2019t want to say no because he doesn\u2019t want to\u00a0*normalize*\u00a0anyone saying no to anyone in this family (my father thrives on no one being allowed to have boundaries or say no, but it\u2019s now also become a prison he\u2019s built himself into).\n\nSo, he was planning to pawn the kids off on me next summer. He was going to agree to take them and then bring them to my house and (in his words) \u201cease into a smooth transition\u201d from his house to mine. From the sounds of it -and also just knowing my dad- I assume he was going to beg me to take the kids for a single day, drop them off with overnight bags and say \u201cdidn\u2019t you say they could sleep over???\u201d then make up a ton of excuses as to why they needed to stay at my house for longer and longer until he ran out the summer. Personally, I know this wouldn\u2019t have worked. I\u2019d literally be dropping the kids off at their own damn house or calling the cops within 24 hours. But I don\u2019t think my dad understands just how badly his plan would have panned out because I used to be a massive doormat. I think he truly believes he could manipulate the situation (and me) into working out in his favor.\n\nHe apparently asked SIL already if it was ok and she said yes (but she never even asked me about it or brought it up the whole time we were all wondering what my dad was on about??) she only confirmed this AFTER my dad finally admitted to his scheme (Which is WILD because she had just stood there and said NOTHING about it while my brothers and I were trying to figure out if our dad was insane) and tbh I think SIL knew the whole time that my dad was going to fully pawn her kids onto me and she didn\u2019t want to say anything and risk having to have her children\u00a0*gasp*\u00a0living in her OWN house ALL YEAR!!!! I truly don\u2019t know what she THOUGHT was about to happen and when I asked her \u201cso, you didn\u2019t think you should even confirm this with me?\u201d she swore that she \u201cremembered talking to me about it\u201d\u2026which\u2026no, girl! You did not! I would NEVER agree to that.\n\nMy brother is fairly livid with his wife (he generally hates how reliant she is on outside help to raise the kids when he\u2019s already such an involved dad and they literally have multiple forms of paid childcare). And we are all becoming increasingly less patient with my father\u2019s triangulation bullshit.\n\nLike, I\u2019m in my 30\u2019s, my older brothers are both pushing 50 and it\u2019s insane that he\u2019s STILL scheming and claiming it\u2019s all in the name of \u201cwhat\u2019s best for the family\u201d\u2026because we all have OUR OWN families now but he acts like we are bickering children who he is having to manage in order to keep the family together (extra insane because my brothers and I were not children at the same time), when really he\u2019s just obsessively trying to maintain HIS preferred status quo in a reality where it makes less and less sense to maintain.\n\nThis was all so foolish and I\u2019m truly annoyed. Like I said, I\u2019ve had a LOT going before and since his initial outburst. A lot of good things that needed my attention and some really hard things too. And instead of getting to be more fully present in what was going on in my own life, I had my focus split and pulled away by worrying that my father was potentially suffering from neurological issues and refusing to be seen for it. My brothers and I all just wasted SO much time on this, all for this to be some stupid bullshit about his pride and him applying his own preferences to our lives AGAIN.\n\nAnyway, thank you again to everyone who gave me good insight and advice. I really appreciate ya\u2019ll being here when I was spinning out about it.\n\n***Some of OOP's Comments:***\n\n**neon\\_lesbean:** I was actually wondering about you earlier this week! God, just reading this was infuriating, I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re dealing with it. Anyway enjoy having your house to yourself!\n\n&gt;**OOP:** Thank you! We are! My sister in laws \u201capology\u201d involved \u201coffering to bring the kids over for a fun day\u201d at my house and I told her her actions have caused me to not want the kids over for the foreseeable future. She\u2019s fuming\n\n*Example of dad's triangulation:*\n\n&gt;When I was in my early 20\u2019s and my brother was in his mid 40\u2019s our dad accidentally triangulated a wedge between us that took YEARS to resolved just because he wanted my brother to work more and he wanted me to pick my brothers kids up from school every day to accomplish that. He could have just come out and said that both of us \u201cI want YOU to get more work done, and I want\u00a0*you*\u00a0to pick his kids up so he doesn\u2019t have to break midday to do that\u201d but instead he created this convoluted and complicated game of fake telephone that ended in my brother and I both absolutely hating the other and feeling massively insulted.  \nWe didn\u2019t realize this until YEARS later.\n\n*OOP adds:*\n\n&gt;My brother is an extremely active father, actually AND they employ daily childcare. It\u2019s just that my sil is on a constant mission to get those kids away from her. She acts like spending one whopping whole week with her kids (still with their childcare, mind you) without being able to drop them off with someone else will literally kill her.  \nI understand my brother\u2019s frustration because every time he turns around his wife has made another plan to shuttle their kids off and away from them for as long as possible.  \nIf there\u2019s a snow forecast she will purposefully rush them over to families houses so they can get snowed in there. During Covid she desperately tried to get them quarantined with her parents in another state (like when there was talk of a lockdown she was RUSHING, driving all day and overnight to get them there and get back home so that they\u2019d be \u201cstuck\u201d with her mom and dad during the lockdown).  \nShe flat out refuses to be alone with her children and is constantly angling to sen them elsewhere away from her.\n\n**SallyAmazeballs:** Wow, your SIL sucks. A couple weeks in the summer is one thing, but the whole summer with no-structure Grandpa is just setting herself up for failure as a parent. Kids need structure and healthy food to have the best chances at growing up to their full potential.\u00a0\n\n&gt;**OOP:** Yeah, it\u2019s never been my place obviously but I have always been astonished by how much she pushes for her kids to stay with my dad because he has essentially systematically instilled his own disordered eating (my dad is a severely obese junk food addict and binger) onto my nephews. They were flagged as being extremely overweight at 9 despite being fairly active kids and it\u2019s only gotten worse since. They sneak and hide food, they run up their lunch debt at school (it\u2019s not a financial issue for my brother or SIL but it\u2019s just that the kids are buying LOADS of snacks), and they binge until they get sick.  \nI don\u2019t know what the hell she\u2019s thinking by prioritizing having her kids out of her house over having them home and trying to turn their relationship with food around.  \nMy brother and I BOTH had struggles with serious restrictive eating disorders because of how warped of a relationship with food our dad gave us (my brother STILL, at almost 50, struggles with relapsing into bulimia) that have landed us both in the hospital multiple times.  \nHe and I were talking about it and he was telling me that it actually makes him feel SO worried and upset and awful when they leave the kids with my dad because he feels like he\u2019s letting them down, but that my SIL sets these things up behind his back and then throws fits and freaks out and vacillates between not speaking to him and non-stop arguing or threatening to just disappear into the night if he doesn\u2019t agree to send the kids to my dads.  \nI guess this last incident was kind of eye opening because it really was BIZARRE that she just stood there like a dead fish for MONTHS while my brothers and I were frantic that my dad had a brain tumor or something\n\n*OOP adds:*\n\n&gt;Absolutely. I DO have real sympathy for her. The moment they told me they were pregnant I was immediately thinking \u201coh my god, she\u2019s not a fit mother\u201d. I know that sounds horrible, but she is truly the most fragile and anxious person I\u2019ve ever met. She shuts down (and I mean SHUTS. DOWN.) over the smallest things (stuff that wouldn\u2019t break most people\u2019s stride) to the point of paralysis.  \nShe always wanted ONE child, for it to be a girl, and for the girl to be a quiet and calm kid like she and my brother (and all my siblings and I tbh, so it wasn\u2019t a bad bet) were. Instead, she got pregnant with twin boys who ended up having severe hyperactivity and focus problems.  \nThis was worst case scenario for her. I really wish they\u2019d just done IVF so she could have had her one girl, I don\u2019t think she\u2019d be so frantic to pawn a daughter off all the time\n\n*Nephews:*\n\n&gt;I do have serious sympathy for my nephews. They\u2019ve been spoiled to such a damaging degree and now they\u2019re getting bullied and socially punished at school for being entitled bratty cry babies.  \nIt sucked to literally watch my family (my sil is not the only one to blame here) either insist upon or passively endorse the consistent decision to make them into worse and worse little people.  \nMy dad is so astonished at how horrible their behavior is and he keeps exclaiming about it \u201ccoming out of nowhere\u201d when I feel like I\u2019ve been watching a slow motion train crash for years", "author_fullname": "t2_51nvnr4", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "New Update: Dad hates my house and apparently expects me to take in my brother\u2019s children at some point?", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/BestofRedditorUpdates", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_1qmafmp", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "author_flair_background_color": "transparent", "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 7980, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": "b04d29d4-d615-11ee-ae7e-facd94046978", "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "NEW UPDATE", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 7980, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1769319565.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1769319142.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.BestofRedditorUpdates", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I am NOT the Original Poster.

But in this moment, as the only blood-related woman on my father\u2019s side of the family it\u00a0&lt;em&gt;feels&lt;/em&gt;\u00a0gendered. Idk, maybe I\u2019m wrong.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A few days ago my dad came over to my house for the first time in quite a while. I\u2019ve had a lot of renovations done since he last saw the place when we first moved in. I have a nervous system condition which, while very fortunate to be able to manage it in such a way that it\u00a0&lt;em&gt;usually&lt;/em&gt;\u00a0doesn\u2019t impact my life\u00a0&lt;em&gt;most days out of any given month&lt;/em&gt;, can render certain simple tasks very difficult for me when I\u2019m having a flare. It\u2019s also important -as part of managing my condition and maintaining my high level of function- to limit certain activities which can bring about a crash or a flare. My husband is also disabled -he has hypermobile eds- so together we made a list of things we\u2019d love to have as accommodations in the home we share and we either DIYed those things or found contractors to do them for us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m really happy with the results. I find that these accommodating renovations make my life a lot easier, I have fewer crashes, and overall more energy. My husband is ELATED with how much more functional he can be after we made these changes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My father isn\u2019t a fan. He thinks it all makes the house \u201ctoo weird\u201d. He\u2019s worried about the resell value (not that we\u2019re planning to sell anytime soon??). He had a lot of comments when he came over, in fact it was almost all he talked about. I kept trying to gently tell him that this is just what works for us and then divert the subject but he was getting a bit worked up which isn\u2019t really like him in those types of situations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The plan for his visit was he\u2019d come over, meet my foster dog that he might adopt, and take the dogs for a walk then get lunch. When I left him alone for a minute to go use the bathroom after we\u2019d walked the dogs, I came back out and found that he\u2019d attempted to pull one of our accommodating mechanisms out of the kitchen wall. He hadn\u2019t caused any functional damage but he did cause aesthetic damage in that it will now need to be repainted over.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was shocked and kind of hysterical in my reaction and I raised my voice at him when I saw what he was doing. I think I yelled \u201cwhat the fuck are you doing, dad?? What\u2019s your problem?!\u201d and he responded \u201cI just wanted to see if it was removable! Sorry! it\u2019s just too weird! It\u2019s too weird it\u2019s just not going to work when Billy and Bobby move in with you\u201d.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cBilly and Bobby\u201d are my nephews. My brother\u2019s kids. I have never invited them to stay with me -let alone MOVE IN- for any amount of time, and I\u2019ve never been asked to do so. Even in the event that my brother and sister in law passed away in some tragic manner; to my knowledge I should be very far down a VERY long list of people who could be asked to take those kids in before I would be asked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, I was pretty shocked my dad would say something like that out of the blue (and with so much frustrated emotion) about Billy and Bobby \u201cmoving in\u201d because there\u2019s no reason -to my knowledge- for anyone to think that would possibly be happening. I asked him to clarify repeatedly but he just waved it off and told me to forget he said anything and he didn\u2019t want to talk about it. I pressed him and all he said was \u201cwell, honey, it\u2019s a massive house! You have room for two boys!\u201d. When I asked him why he would even bring it up though, and clarified that not only did I have absolutely no desire to host my nephews for a visit let alone to \u201cmove them in\u201d he clammed up again and just said \u201cforget I ever said anything\u201d. He apologized for damaging my home, immediately transferred a larger sum than necessary to me via Zelle to fix the scratch he\u2019d made and then took me out to lunch as we planned prior.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The rest of the day with him was pretty normal and I guess I was just a little shocked or something because I didn\u2019t bring it up again. But now that it\u2019s been a few days I can\u2019t get it out of my head and I\u2019m so annoyed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First of all, my dad hasn\u2019t ever been and would NEVER be that aggressive about any decoration or renovation in my brother\u2019s homes. He just wouldn\u2019t. And I can\u2019t help but feel that he is less respectful of my home because I\u2019m a woman. Which sucks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But more upsetting/confusing\u2026.what the fuck was he talking about in terms of my nephews??? Like, is my family conspiring in some way to move those kids in with me? It wouldn\u2019t be the first time that my family assumed I\u2019d take care of those kids without asking me first but in the past it was just babysitting and I have directly told EVERYONE that even\u00a0&lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt;\u00a0is unacceptable, so I would be really shocked if my brother/sil thought that was acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I guess I\u2019m just spinning out and don\u2019t really know what to do about it. I\u2019m stuck between asking my father about it again first or just reaching out to my brother directly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Some of OOP&amp;#39;s Comments:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;one_bean_hahahaha:&lt;/strong&gt; Is there something wrong with your brother that he can&amp;#39;t raise his own kids?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OOP:&lt;/strong&gt;\u00a0No, nothing wrong. To my knowledge my brother isn\u2019t looking to move his kids out of his own home either.&lt;br/&gt;\nThey are sometimes difficult kids. A little delayed and a lot entitled/enabled. In the past they\u2019ve leaned heavily on family for childcare since my brother has a demanding job and my sil has a hard time being alone with her kids. When I lived with my dad I was a big part of that equation and ended up being more responsible for those kids then I\u2019d have agreed to, because I wasn\u2019t in control of telling them if they could bring the kids over as it was my father\u2019s house. But even when I still lived with my dad I was able to establish some boundaries and assert that I wouldn\u2019t agree to care for them on demand, and that was generally respected after I put my foot down a few times.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hawkson2020:&lt;/strong&gt; I\u2019d definitely try to get more info from your dad, but failing that it wouldn\u2019t be bad to talk to your brother? It seems like a really out of pocket thing to say unless he has some serious information you don\u2019t.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OOP:&lt;/strong&gt;\u00a0It\u2019s incredibly out of pocket.&lt;br/&gt;\nNot only do I not want those kids to live with me, but I also would assume that my brother wouldn\u2019t want his kids to live with me. There are a million reasons why, but chiefly it wouldn\u2019t be a good idea safety-wise for those kids!&lt;br/&gt;\nI\u2019ve been dealing with a stalker for years who has already threatened me that she would harm my nephews, at which point I distanced myself from Billy and Bobby (stopped picking them up from school etc) and the threats directed at them stopped.&lt;br/&gt;\nCurrently I\u2019m working on taking legal action but nothing is set in stone and even the idea of those kids -who are difficult but who I also love very much- being in my home makes me worried that they would be directly targeted or that there would be some escalation.&lt;br/&gt;\nI actually can\u2019t imagine that my family would think it\u2019s a good idea to move those kids in with me. Like, I can\u2019t imagine circumstances where that would seem appropriate&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hawkson2020:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, particularly given that information (but even without it) it\u2019s hard to imagine your brother or sil would want or expect you to take in their kids short of some kind of serious health or relationship emergency.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And even then, that wouldn\u2019t be something for your dad to be concerned about unless he\u2019s a particularly worrying person.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OOP:&lt;/strong&gt;\u00a0Even if there\u2019s an emergency, I simply cannot be the first person on their list to take those kids in. I\u2019m the only younger female blood relative I guess but there are SO many other relatives and family friends who need to come before me on that list. My brother and SIL have a MASSIVE village, so I\u2019m talking DOZENS. It\u2019s baffling to me that it would come down to me to take those kids in under any circumstances&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brattius:&lt;/strong&gt; The fact that he was actively trying to tear your house apart is a Hugh red flag. My bet is your brother is getting a divorce and they were just going to &amp;#39;dump&amp;#39; then on you since his job is so demanding&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OOP:&lt;/strong&gt;\u00a0Honestly\u2026.I feel like a fucking idiot that the two of them getting divorced hadn\u2019t even crossed my mind\u2026.&lt;br/&gt;\nNot that they have an actively bad marriage or anything, but I think their dynamic is weird and I guess I wouldn\u2019t be shocked.&lt;br/&gt;\nThank you for this insight.&lt;br/&gt;\nI mean, either way it\u2019s a no from me for various reasons.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Puzzleheaded-Ad7606:&lt;/strong&gt; BETTER YET: Group text to them- Guys, I&amp;#39;m worried about Dad. He came over the other day and kinda flipped out about our disability accomations and tried to rip one off the wall. Then he thought Billy and Bobby where coming to live here, but couldn&amp;#39;t explain why. I&amp;#39;m worried, has anyone else noticed strange, aggressive behavior?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OOP:&lt;/strong&gt;\u00a0I think I\u2019ll go with this, but on a call. I want to hear a response in real time. My dad has normalized triangulation a bit too much in this family for my comfort&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Example of triangulation:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Dad will say \u201cyour brother is REALLY upset that you said you can\u2019t go to his birthday dinner he EVEN said he\u2019ll move it up an hour just so you can come and I know that you\u2019d still need to move your schedule around even if it\u2019s an hour earlier but he REALLY wants to make it easier for you because he REALLY wants you there!\u201d when my brother said neither of those things.&lt;br/&gt;\nThen he\u2019ll tell my brother \u201cyour sister is HEART BROKEN that she can\u2019t make it to your party and she doesn\u2019t want to say anything but she\u2019s hurt that you aren\u2019t having it an hour earlier so she can make it!\u201d When I said neither of those things.&lt;br/&gt;\nAnd he does all this because he wants the whole family at my brothers party and doesn\u2019t like the idea of the whole family not being present. So my brother moves his party up an hour because he thinks that\u2019s what I said I wanted, I move my schedule around to go to his party because that\u2019s what I think he wanted. And both of us feel kind of weird and resentful and strange and neither of us find out that we got played until we casually talk about the incident ten years later&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IAmMelonLord:&lt;/strong&gt; How old is your dad? Could he be having a sort of mental episode that he thinks your nephews are supposed to move in with you? Barring that, I\u2019d ask your brother \u201chey, do you have any idea why dad would say this? Is something going on?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OOP:&lt;/strong&gt;\u00a0He\u2019s in his 70\u2019s but he\u2019s still sharp enough to be working. I asked my other brother (nebulously without mentioning the reason why) who works with my dad every day if he\u2019d noticed any decline and he said dad seems sharp as ever in their work environment. It\u2019s pretty mentally demanding work so I think it would be evident there.&lt;br/&gt;\nI\u2019ll also note though, my dad \u201crejected\u201d an OCD diagnosis when he was in therapy after my parents divorce. So he\u2019s not without any history of mental illness\u2026.not sure if that would cause this behavior though.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;QueenMEB120:&lt;/strong&gt; If this is a new development, it may be a UTI. The symptoms of an undiagnosed UTI can mimic early stage dementia. And UTI&amp;#39;s can have no physical symptoms, like burning or pain during urination, in the early stages. Look up Silent UTI&amp;#39;s.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OOP:&lt;/strong&gt;\u00a0Oh shit! Dad has gotten several UTIs before! Just googled it and I had no clue that they could be \u201csilent\u201d or that they could impact cognition!!!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Selsia6:&lt;/strong&gt; Is your dad OK with your and your husband&amp;#39;s disabilities? It sounds abelist, like he was trying to remove the reminder of your disability and then came up with a nonsensical excuse after the fact.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OOP:&lt;/strong&gt;\u00a0My dad is in utter denial that I\u2019m disabled. He only briefly accepted when my symptoms were severe and I couldn\u2019t work, but after I started my own business he\u2019s basically just been totally averse to the idea that I need to manage my symptoms and thinks I\u2019m being dramatic.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;People ask several questions about the stalker OOP mentioned in one of the comments:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s ok. She\u2019s someone I used to be friends with and honestly it\u2019s my bad because I hung in there even when I realized she was becoming mentally unstable.&lt;br/&gt;\nShe became fixated on my husband when he and I began dating and I became the enemy in her eyes.&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;On if dad takes the stalking seriously:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\nNo, he does actually take her seriously, This woman has stalked him too and done property damage to his house.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update (Same Post): May 2, 2025 (Next Day)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I talked to my brother on the phone about the situation and he expressed that he had absolutely no idea why our father would imply that Billy and Bobby would need to move in with me at any point. He seemed genuinely surprised and to have no clue what the hell dad was talking about. He claims to have absolutely never expressed anything like that to our dad. I believe him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I asked him if there was any possible reason\u00a0&lt;em&gt;at all&lt;/em&gt;\u00a0that dad would think that I\u2019d need to take in my nephews. Like is there some problem dad thinks he is pre-solving without consulting either of us? Is there an illness or impending divorce or ANYTHING I don\u2019t know about? My brother assured me that there\u2019s nothing like that going on and that -as I assumed- I, of course, wouldn\u2019t even be near the top of the list of permanent caregivers even if something WAS going on because he knows I run two businesses out of my house and also just am not up for taking his kids in unless I am the absolute last safe resort.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Both of us are in agreement (as is our other oldest brother) that dad generally doesn\u2019t seem to have any other signs that we\u2019ve noticed of declining cognitive function\u2026.like at all. But since this was such a strange outburst we\u2019re still concerned that this is just the earliest sign. My brother -Billy and Bobby\u2019s dad- is going to talk to our dad about it asap and see what he says or what explanation he can give, then we\u2019ll go from there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The issue that we\u2019re both aware of is that my dad, while a loving father and good man to many, is a bit of a liar and a lot of a manipulator. He has a lot of signs of OCD and gets fixated on things, then tries to manipulate to get his way with his fixation. He means well, but he has been known to be full of shit and to have his own strange agendas that don\u2019t have much to do with anyone else\u2019s wants or needs. So unfortunately my brother and I (and my brother has volunteered to go first lol) are going to have to confront him by essentially saying \u201cdad, it\u2019s really important that you\u2019re honest about wether you are\u00a0&lt;em&gt;confused&lt;/em&gt;\u00a0or intentionally lying/triangulating/manipulating because that\u2019s the difference between us freaking out about your health vs us just understanding that sometimes you lie to push your agenda but your brain is fine\u201d.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you to everyone who gave me feedback here! You\u2019ve all been so sweet and supportive except that one guy who for some reason was dead convinced that I didn\u2019t pay for my own home and commented several times and DMed me about it (I did pay for my home, and it\u2019s solely in my name\u2026.you weirdo).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019ll keep y\u2019all updated on what my brother and I figure out going forward!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;New Update&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;*****Update&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1q9bius/update_on_dad_hating_my_houseexpecting_me_to_take/\"&gt;Post&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;: January 10, 2026 (8 months later)****\\&lt;/strong&gt;*&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know this was forever ago, but life has been lifing pretty hard since then.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The og post and first update which I made at the top of the original are in my post history.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First of all I just want to thank everyone for your concern and overall support. This sub is full of such lovely and helpful people. So many of you left tremendously helpful comments and sent me such kind messages as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I guess I\u2019ll start by saying that my dad doesn\u2019t have dementia or Alzheimer\u2019s or anything like that. If\u00a0&lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt;\u00a0he is perhaps experiencing a very slight cognitive decline due to age, but only insofar as his typical lifelong nonsense becoming a little more pronounced and he\u2019s not really as slick as he thinks he is or as good at manipulating as he\u2019s used to being. Basically, he\u2019s used to being able to get away with a lot more manipulation of his kids than he\u2019s able to get away with now. I don\u2019t even think the onus for this particular episode of his is directly an age thing at all though, I think it\u2019s a situational thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After I talked to my dad multiple times, conferred with my brothers after they talked to my dad multiple times and after we basically had to tell our father \u201chey, if you\u2019re not totally upfront about what\u2019s going on we have to assume that you need to see a doctor and we\u2019re NOT just going to drop this like we usually drop uncomfortable things in this family\u201d\u2026I think I have figured out what was up:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ever since I moved out of my father\u2019s house -leaving an empty bedroom and office space in a house that ALREADY had a designated bedroom for the kids because they had a lot sleepovers there- my sister in law has been obsessively pushing the idea that my nephews should start living summers and school breaks at my dad\u2019s house. I knew she\u2019d brought this up a few times but I didn\u2019t know how adamant she was being because this push entirely took place after I had moved. My dad doesn\u2019t live far from my brother and SIL\u2019s place (15 minutes away) so it\u2019s not like they\u2019d be having some special summer experience in a new location\u2026I think she just wants them out of her house for the summer lol\u2026&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My nephews LOVE staying at grandpas because my dad has never been a real caregiver (not even when we were kids) so there are literally no rules, no bedtimes, no limit on sweets, no parental controls on the tv, no limit on screen times, no one checking if they brushed their teeth or making them shower or do chores or change their clothes, zero supervision over them making messes or doing dumb shit etc. So of course when their mom asked them \u201cdo you want to spend the summer at grandpas?! Do you want to go ask grandpa if he\u2019ll let you stay the summer with him???\u201d they went feral over the idea and my dad was immediately put in the position of either agreeing or disappointing his two grandkids and saying no. My dad hates saying no to family outright, because he NEVER wants family to say no to him at all. So he agreed, of course.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My dad agreed to this last summer, But even with the help of a daily babysitter (who apparently quit halfway through, and I assume it\u2019s either because my dad made her uncomfortable-which is a whole different kettle of fish-, or because those kids are SUPER entitled), and even though the kids are getting more and more independent, it was torturous and exhausting for him. He never wanted to do that again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But (and my dad didn\u2019t say this, this is me applying what I know about him in general) my father is addicted to being the hero of the family. He needs us all to need him and he needs us all to think he\u2019s great. PLUS he has a massive ego about defying the idea of aging and being ultra energetic and healthy etc, and not \u201can old man\u201d. He could not bring himself to admit that he doesn\u2019t have the energy for those kids, and he didn\u2019t want to say no because he doesn\u2019t want to\u00a0&lt;em&gt;normalize&lt;/em&gt;\u00a0anyone saying no to anyone in this family (my father thrives on no one being allowed to have boundaries or say no, but it\u2019s now also become a prison he\u2019s built himself into).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, he was planning to pawn the kids off on me next summer. He was going to agree to take them and then bring them to my house and (in his words) \u201cease into a smooth transition\u201d from his house to mine. From the sounds of it -and also just knowing my dad- I assume he was going to beg me to take the kids for a single day, drop them off with overnight bags and say \u201cdidn\u2019t you say they could sleep over???\u201d then make up a ton of excuses as to why they needed to stay at my house for longer and longer until he ran out the summer. Personally, I know this wouldn\u2019t have worked. I\u2019d literally be dropping the kids off at their own damn house or calling the cops within 24 hours. But I don\u2019t think my dad understands just how badly his plan would have panned out because I used to be a massive doormat. I think he truly believes he could manipulate the situation (and me) into working out in his favor.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He apparently asked SIL already if it was ok and she said yes (but she never even asked me about it or brought it up the whole time we were all wondering what my dad was on about??) she only confirmed this AFTER my dad finally admitted to his scheme (Which is WILD because she had just stood there and said NOTHING about it while my brothers and I were trying to figure out if our dad was insane) and tbh I think SIL knew the whole time that my dad was going to fully pawn her kids onto me and she didn\u2019t want to say anything and risk having to have her children\u00a0&lt;em&gt;gasp&lt;/em&gt;\u00a0living in her OWN house ALL YEAR!!!! I truly don\u2019t know what she THOUGHT was about to happen and when I asked her \u201cso, you didn\u2019t think you should even confirm this with me?\u201d she swore that she \u201cremembered talking to me about it\u201d\u2026which\u2026no, girl! You did not! I would NEVER agree to that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My brother is fairly livid with his wife (he generally hates how reliant she is on outside help to raise the kids when he\u2019s already such an involved dad and they literally have multiple forms of paid childcare). And we are all becoming increasingly less patient with my father\u2019s triangulation bullshit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like, I\u2019m in my 30\u2019s, my older brothers are both pushing 50 and it\u2019s insane that he\u2019s STILL scheming and claiming it\u2019s all in the name of \u201cwhat\u2019s best for the family\u201d\u2026because we all have OUR OWN families now but he acts like we are bickering children who he is having to manage in order to keep the family together (extra insane because my brothers and I were not children at the same time), when really he\u2019s just obsessively trying to maintain HIS preferred status quo in a reality where it makes less and less sense to maintain.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This was all so foolish and I\u2019m truly annoyed. Like I said, I\u2019ve had a LOT going before and since his initial outburst. A lot of good things that needed my attention and some really hard things too. And instead of getting to be more fully present in what was going on in my own life, I had my focus split and pulled away by worrying that my father was potentially suffering from neurological issues and refusing to be seen for it. My brothers and I all just wasted SO much time on this, all for this to be some stupid bullshit about his pride and him applying his own preferences to our lives AGAIN.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, thank you again to everyone who gave me good insight and advice. I really appreciate ya\u2019ll being here when I was spinning out about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Some of OOP&amp;#39;s Comments:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;neon_lesbean:&lt;/strong&gt; I was actually wondering about you earlier this week! God, just reading this was infuriating, I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re dealing with it. Anyway enjoy having your house to yourself!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OOP:&lt;/strong&gt; Thank you! We are! My sister in laws \u201capology\u201d involved \u201coffering to bring the kids over for a fun day\u201d at my house and I told her her actions have caused me to not want the kids over for the foreseeable future. She\u2019s fuming&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Example of dad&amp;#39;s triangulation:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;When I was in my early 20\u2019s and my brother was in his mid 40\u2019s our dad accidentally triangulated a wedge between us that took YEARS to resolved just because he wanted my brother to work more and he wanted me to pick my brothers kids up from school every day to accomplish that. He could have just come out and said that both of us \u201cI want YOU to get more work done, and I want\u00a0&lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;\u00a0to pick his kids up so he doesn\u2019t have to break midday to do that\u201d but instead he created this convoluted and complicated game of fake telephone that ended in my brother and I both absolutely hating the other and feeling massively insulted.&lt;br/&gt;\nWe didn\u2019t realize this until YEARS later.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;OOP adds:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;My brother is an extremely active father, actually AND they employ daily childcare. It\u2019s just that my sil is on a constant mission to get those kids away from her. She acts like spending one whopping whole week with her kids (still with their childcare, mind you) without being able to drop them off with someone else will literally kill her.&lt;br/&gt;\nI understand my brother\u2019s frustration because every time he turns around his wife has made another plan to shuttle their kids off and away from them for as long as possible.&lt;br/&gt;\nIf there\u2019s a snow forecast she will purposefully rush them over to families houses so they can get snowed in there. During Covid she desperately tried to get them quarantined with her parents in another state (like when there was talk of a lockdown she was RUSHING, driving all day and overnight to get them there and get back home so that they\u2019d be \u201cstuck\u201d with her mom and dad during the lockdown).&lt;br/&gt;\nShe flat out refuses to be alone with her children and is constantly angling to sen them elsewhere away from her.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SallyAmazeballs:&lt;/strong&gt; Wow, your SIL sucks. A couple weeks in the summer is one thing, but the whole summer with no-structure Grandpa is just setting herself up for failure as a parent. Kids need structure and healthy food to have the best chances at growing up to their full potential.\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OOP:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, it\u2019s never been my place obviously but I have always been astonished by how much she pushes for her kids to stay with my dad because he has essentially systematically instilled his own disordered eating (my dad is a severely obese junk food addict and binger) onto my nephews. They were flagged as being extremely overweight at 9 despite being fairly active kids and it\u2019s only gotten worse since. They sneak and hide food, they run up their lunch debt at school (it\u2019s not a financial issue for my brother or SIL but it\u2019s just that the kids are buying LOADS of snacks), and they binge until they get sick.&lt;br/&gt;\nI don\u2019t know what the hell she\u2019s thinking by prioritizing having her kids out of her house over having them home and trying to turn their relationship with food around.&lt;br/&gt;\nMy brother and I BOTH had struggles with serious restrictive eating disorders because of how warped of a relationship with food our dad gave us (my brother STILL, at almost 50, struggles with relapsing into bulimia) that have landed us both in the hospital multiple times.&lt;br/&gt;\nHe and I were talking about it and he was telling me that it actually makes him feel SO worried and upset and awful when they leave the kids with my dad because he feels like he\u2019s letting them down, but that my SIL sets these things up behind his back and then throws fits and freaks out and vacillates between not speaking to him and non-stop arguing or threatening to just disappear into the night if he doesn\u2019t agree to send the kids to my dads.&lt;br/&gt;\nI guess this last incident was kind of eye opening because it really was BIZARRE that she just stood there like a dead fish for MONTHS while my brothers and I were frantic that my dad had a brain tumor or something&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;OOP adds:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Absolutely. I DO have real sympathy for her. The moment they told me they were pregnant I was immediately thinking \u201coh my god, she\u2019s not a fit mother\u201d. I know that sounds horrible, but she is truly the most fragile and anxious person I\u2019ve ever met. She shuts down (and I mean SHUTS. DOWN.) over the smallest things (stuff that wouldn\u2019t break most people\u2019s stride) to the point of paralysis.&lt;br/&gt;\nShe always wanted ONE child, for it to be a girl, and for the girl to be a quiet and calm kid like she and my brother (and all my siblings and I tbh, so it wasn\u2019t a bad bet) were. Instead, she got pregnant with twin boys who ended up having severe hyperactivity and focus problems.&lt;br/&gt;\nThis was worst case scenario for her. I really wish they\u2019d just done IVF so she could have had her one girl, I don\u2019t think she\u2019d be so frantic to pawn a daughter off all the time&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nephews:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I do have serious sympathy for my nephews. They\u2019ve been spoiled to such a damaging degree and now they\u2019re getting bullied and socially punished at school for being entitled bratty cry babies.&lt;br/&gt;\nIt sucked to literally watch my family (my sil is not the only one to blame here) either insist upon or passively endorse the consistent decision to make them into worse and worse little people.&lt;br/&gt;\nMy dad is so astonished at how horrible their behavior is and he keeps exclaiming about it \u201ccoming out of nowhere\u201d when I feel like I\u2019ve been watching a slow motion train crash for years&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false,

injuries!&lt;\n\n**MOOD SPOILER:** &gt;!concerning to terrifying, outlook worrying!&lt;\n\n[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7f6ch1/how_do_i_31f_tell_my_colleague_44f_her_behaviour/)  **Nov 24, 2017**\n\n[Copy of the post](https://imgur.com/a/pVCBZh0)\n\nI've been working on a remote mine site for about 18 months. Have really only started being friends with this woman in the last 6 months. We work 2 weeks and then go home for a week. My general work philosophy is I'm here to work not make friends. So I am quite happy not having friends and just doing my job. But I figured whats the worse that could happen right?\n\nSo to start things off. She's got bipolar so her moods are up and down all the time and frankly she can be down right scary when her moods are down.\n\nWhen we initially started hanging out we made a joke about dildos. Im a fairly open minded person and I do like a good joke. However since that joke she has been sending me photos of dildos almost everyday... Ive stopped replying to them. But apparently that didn't work.\n\nA few weeks later she told me that she thought I was hot and I had gorgeous eyes but she wouldn't try anything with me because she knows I have a boyfriend. Since then she keeps telling me how attracted she is to me. I've told her I am flattered but I'm not into women (which was kind of a lie. She's just not the type of woman I'd be interested in regardless).\n\nShe laid off for a little while which made me think maybe she's not too bad. Some how she invited her self over to my house. I don't drink a lot because Ive had issues in the past. I told her she could swing by but I wasn't going to be drinking. So she comes over with her own booze and gets hammered. I let my dogs in side for a little bit, one wasn't interested in her. So she called her a \"fat fuck\" on several occasions. I took my dogs out because they shouldn't be treated like that - even if they don't understand whats being said to them. Since then she kweps trying to invite herself around and to be honest I see enough of her at work. I like my own space. Even when it comes to my boyfriend!\n\nShe keeps questioning the relationship I have with my boyfriend of 4 years. Asking whether or not I should be with him. She's only met him once and doesn't want to hang around me when he is around (he also works up at the same mine site occassionally depending on what work he's got on). Yet she keeps telling me and other people how \"hot\" he is and that I shouldn't worry because she wont try anything.\n\nMost recently. She told me that she had a sex dream about me and she had to tell me so it wouldn't be weird. Which I dont get... because now its certainly more weird.\n\nOn top of all that she doesn't respect my personal space. She will try to touch me. Shes always nudging me with her elbow. Which is irritating AF! I don't like being touched, never have. I think she thinks shes being subtle about it... but it totally obvious to me. For example I show her a phote on my phone and she grabs it so she has to touch my hand despite there being plenty of room to grab the phone without making contact.\n\nIdk what to do. She's bat shit crazy and will probably kill me in my sleep!\n\nTl:dr; colleague is bat shit crazy. Keeps sending me dildo photos. Tells me Im hot and have gorgeous eyes - but not to worry she won't try anything. Questions my 4 year relationship with my boyfriend yet tells me and anyone else who will listen how hot my boyfriend is, but its okay she wont try anything on him either. Tells me about the sex dreams she has about me. And tries to touch me. Wtf do I do about it?\n\nEDIT: I forgot to mention that she seems obsessed with mine and my boyfriends bedroom habits.... like she will ask me what I did on my rnr and before I can reply she'll say something like I bet you had heaps of sex. Truth of it is we are more likely to be smashing out the video games than each other!\n\n**RELEVANT COMMENTS**\n\n**VonLinus**\n\n&gt;That does sound like sexual harassment. Do you have a HR policy? \n\n&gt;Like I realise Mining sites in the middle of nowhere are probably somewhat different to a metroplitan office, but if someone was doing that to me, I'd complain.\n\n**OOP**\n\n&gt;&gt;We do. I just don't know if its worth the stress of getting HR involved or if I can try to deal with the situation myself first. Tbh, when I started I thought it was going to be the men Id have to worry about!\n\n**~**\n\n**AMerickanGirl**\n\n&gt;Stop hinting around and just tell her. \u201cStop sending me dildos. Stop asking about my sex life. Stop coming on to me. I\u2019m not interested in you. I don\u2019t want to report you to HR hit this has to stop or I will.\u201d\n\n**OOP**\n\n&gt;&gt;Ive been giving her the cold shoulder. Seems to be working - sort of. Got a message from her today saying shes unhappy and needs to be alone. Yet she is sitting right next to me on smoko... \n\n**~**\n\n**iamMarkPrice**\n\n&gt;Have you told her how you feel?\n\n**OOP**\n\n&gt;&gt;I've made it clear that I have no interest in her or women, sexually. I've made it abundantly clear that I am in love with my boyfriend more than ever. She knows we have just been approved for a loan to build a house together - so things are kind of serious! I've told her that I don't like being touched. In fact yesterday on the bus ride home, she was leaning on me and I told her straight up she was in my bubble. She got cranky and moved seats!\n\n**~**\n\n**intheinferno**\n\n&gt;She likes you! A lot! Like A LOT!\n\n&gt;Can you get reassigned to a different schedule so you aren't around her so often?\n\n&gt;Can you say that your having personal issues and don't want to talk (even if you make up a story)? Perhaps even something tragic?\n\n&gt;She sounds absolutely awful. Never heard of someone calling dogs \"fat fucks\". That is absolutely bizarre...on any level.\n\n&gt;The sex-dream thing is her just trying to do anything to get you to do something with her.\n\n&gt;I honestly don't have many other suggestions...your situation is unlike anything I've ever heard. I would just keep trying to display no interest and keep my distance from her.\n\n**OOP**\n\n&gt;&gt;Ive been trying to get other roles at work so I can avoid her. My last resort would be to change my roster. I don't really want to do that as it is a bit of  hassle and they wont just let you switch around with out a valid reason. \n\n&gt;&gt;My partner will be up here more often in the coming months as he has some regular work. So she wont hassle me too much while he is around. Which will be a bit of a relief! \n\n&gt;&gt;And yeah. Who calls someones dog a fat fuck! Sure my dog is a bit chubby but its something we're working on! I dont even talk to my dogs like that when they've been naughty! If I was going to be honest thats the one thing thats really irritated me! \n\n[Update: She tried to kill me](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7fqyw9/update_she_tried_to_kill_me_how_do_i_31f_tell_my/)  **Nov 26, 2017 (2 days later)**\n\n[Copy of the update](https://imgur.com/a/7QsJaQ2)\n\nTl;dr: colleague is bat shit crazy. Keeps sending me dildo photos. Tells me Im hot and have gorgeous eyes - but not to worry she won't try anything. Questions my 4 year relationship with my boyfriend yet tells me and anyone else who will listen how hot my boyfriend is, but its okay she wont try anything on him either. Tells me about the sex dreams she has about me. And tries to touch me. Wtf do I do about it?\n\nUpdate:\n\nSo I told her that I am happy to have a friendly professional relationship with her. But, I'm not comfortable with anything more than that. I told her she needs to stop touching me and respect my boundaries.\n\nThe next day I get a text message from her saying \"Morning.. think we should call it a day .. you take care &amp; good luck with all your plans\" (I think she legit thought we had something going on? Idk)\n\nThat evening after work I went to the wet mess to catch up with my boyfriend, who flew up for a break down. We were having a few drinks when she comes up to me and asks if she could talk to me privately. I decline and she pulls out a fucking knife. I managed to put my arm up to shield my face and she slices my arm open. My boyfriend and a few other guys manage to get the knife off her and restrain her.\n\nEverything is a little bit hazy. It took about half an hour for the medic to arrive. They dod the best they can. Then I'm put on an ambulance and driven an hour and a half to the closest hospital. Again they do their best to patch me up, but they don't have the best resources available. Im flying back to my city today and will need to catch up with a plastic surgeon. Unfortunately, I've been told, theres going to be a fair bit of nerve damage. All credit to the doctors here doing the best they can with what they have though.\n\nAs far as I am aware she's been arrested and charged with grievous bodily harm. Haven't really had a chance to catch up with the police myself yet as Ive been in surgery and high on pain killers. They have plenty of witness statements.\n\nNeedless to say, I wont have to worry about her at work anymore. But she does know where I live which is worrying. Im also going to be off work for a while which is going to impact me financially. Im not sure if this counts as workers comp as I was up at work or what. I do have income protection so that will help me out a little bit.\n\nUgh. Any who its taken ages to write this on my phone as I only have one good hand. I feel like I will be more angry once the pain killers wear off.\n\nTl;dr: told her I only wanted a professional relationship. She tried to kill me but only managed to stab me in the arm. Heaps of nerve damage though. Shes been arrested. I'm stuck in a hospital in the middle of the Australian outback. Will be flying home today and catching up with plastic surgeon. Will be off work for a while. Yay.\n\n\n**THIS IS A REPOST SUB - I AM NOT THE OOP** \n\n**DO NOT CONTACT THE OOP's OR COMMENT ON LINKED POSTS, REMEMBER - RULE 7**", "author_fullname": "t2_ikujf6ia", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "How do I (31F) tell my colleague (44F) her behaviour is bordering on sexual harassment and how do I deal with her in general...", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/BestofRedditorUpdates", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_1ju4tm5", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "author_flair_background_color": "transparent", "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4968, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": "bd67c216-02aa-11ef-997e-76d955ea679c", "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "INCONCLUSIVE", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 4968, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "post_hint": "self", "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1744085041.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.BestofRedditorUpdates", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I am not The OOP, OOP is &lt;a href=\"/u/Lonzy\"&gt;u/Lonzy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do I (31F) tell my colleague (44F) her behaviour is bordering on sexual harassment and how do I deal with her in general...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TRIGGER WARNING:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span class=\"md-spoiler-text\"&gt;Stalking, sexual harassment, obsession, physical assault, attempted murder, knife attack, description of injuries&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MOOD SPOILER:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span class=\"md-spoiler-text\"&gt;concerning to terrifying, outlook worrying&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7f6ch1/how_do_i_31f_tell_my_colleague_44f_her_behaviour/\"&gt;Original Post&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;Nov 24, 2017&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/pVCBZh0\"&gt;Copy of the post&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been working on a remote mine site for about 18 months.

I don\u2019t want to report you to HR hit this has to stop or I will.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OOP&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Ive been giving her the cold shoulder. Seems to be working - sort of. Got a message from her today saying shes unhappy and needs to be alone. Yet she is sitting right next to me on smoko... &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;~&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iamMarkPrice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Have you told her how you feel?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OOP&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve made it clear that I have no interest in her or women, sexually. I&amp;#39;ve made it abundantly clear that I am in love with my boyfriend more than ever. She knows we have just been approved for a loan to build a house together - so things are kind of serious! I&amp;#39;ve told her that I don&amp;#39;t like being touched. In fact yesterday on the bus ride home, she was leaning on me and I told her straight up she was in my bubble. She got cranky and moved seats!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;~&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;intheinferno&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;She likes you! A lot! Like A LOT!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Can you get reassigned to a different schedule so you aren&amp;#39;t around her so often?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Can you say that your having personal issues and don&amp;#39;t want to talk (even if you make up a story)? Perhaps even something tragic?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She sounds absolutely awful. Never heard of someone calling dogs &amp;quot;fat fucks&amp;quot;. That is absolutely bizarre...on any level.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The sex-dream thing is her just trying to do anything to get you to do something with her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I honestly don&amp;#39;t have many other suggestions...your situation is unlike anything I&amp;#39;ve ever heard. I would just keep trying to display no interest and keep my distance from her.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OOP&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Ive been trying to get other roles at work so I can avoid her. My last resort would be to change my roster. I don&amp;#39;t really want to do that as it is a bit of  hassle and they wont just let you switch around with out a valid reason. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My partner will be up here more often in the coming months as he has some regular work. So she wont hassle me too much while he is around. Which will be a bit of a relief! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And yeah. Who calls someones dog a fat fuck! Sure my dog is a bit chubby but its something we&amp;#39;re working on! I dont even talk to my dogs like that when they&amp;#39;ve been naughty! If I was going to be honest thats the one thing thats really irritated me! &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7fqyw9/update_she_tried_to_kill_me_how_do_i_31f_tell_my/\"&gt;Update: She tried to kill me&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;Nov 26, 2017 (2 days later)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/7QsJaQ2\"&gt;Copy of the update&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tl;dr: colleague is bat shit crazy. Keeps sending me dildo photos. Tells me Im hot and have gorgeous eyes - but not to worry she won&amp;#39;t try anything. Questions my 4 year relationship with my boyfriend yet tells me and anyone else who will listen how hot my boyfriend is, but its okay she wont try anything on him either. Tells me about the sex dreams she has about me. And tries to touch me. Wtf do I do about it?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Update:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I told her that I am happy to have a friendly professional relationship with her. But, I&amp;#39;m not comfortable with anything more than that. I told her she needs to stop touching me and respect my boundaries.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The next day I get a text message from her saying &amp;quot;Morning.. think we should call it a day .. you take care &amp;amp; good luck with all your plans&amp;quot; (I think she legit thought we had something going on? Idk)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That evening after work I went to the wet mess to catch up with my boyfriend, who flew up for a break down. We were having a few drinks when she comes up to me and asks if she could talk to me privately. I decline and she pulls out a fucking knife. I managed to put my arm up to shield my face and she slices my arm open. My boyfriend and a few other guys manage to get the knife off her and restrain her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Everything is a little bit hazy. It took about half an hour for the medic to arrive. They dod the best they can. Then I&amp;#39;m put on an ambulance and driven an hour and a half to the closest hospital. Again they do their best to patch me up, but they don&amp;#39;t have the best resources available. Im flying back to my city today and will need to catch up with a plastic surgeon. Unfortunately, I&amp;#39;ve been told, theres going to be a fair bit of nerve damage. All credit to the doctors here doing the best they can with what they have though.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As far as I am aware she&amp;#39;s been arrested and charged with grievous bodily harm. Haven&amp;#39;t really had a chance to catch up with the police myself yet as Ive been in surgery and high on pain killers. They have plenty of witness statements.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, I wont have to worry about her at work anymore. But she does know where I live which is worrying. Im also going to be off work for a while which is going to impact me financially. Im not sure if this counts as workers comp as I was up at work or what. I do have income protection so that will help me out a little bit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ugh. Any who its taken ages to write this on my phone as I only have one good hand. I feel like I will be more angry once the pain killers wear off.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tl;dr: told her I only wanted a professional relationship. She tried to kill me but only managed to stab me in the arm. Heaps of nerve damage though. Shes been arrested. I&amp;#39;m stuck in a hospital in the middle of the Australian outback. Will be flying home today and catching up with plastic surgeon. Will be off work for a while. Yay.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THIS IS A REPOST SUB - I AM NOT THE OOP&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DO NOT CONTACT THE OOP&amp;#39;s OR COMMENT ON LINKED POSTS, REMEMBER - RULE 7&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "preview": {"images": [{"source": {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/OPtEY8_GYYzbMI5NNu4rOU0sbCY596kFM1G48ucbuXs.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=df95ac041a4301e841638f51116e0d0982c0f556", "width": 853, "height": 1998}, "resolutions": [{"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/OPtEY8_GYYzbMI5NNu4rOU0sbCY596kFM1G48ucbuXs.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6f6cb244cb668e1255eb847560d36ada897ad7d9", "width": 108, "height": 216}, {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/OPtEY8_GYYzbMI5NNu4rOU0sbCY596kFM1G48ucbuXs.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=92cd04994714ed2456af365abd80d5376c3d8060", "width": 216, "height": 432}, {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/OPtEY8_GYYzbMI5NNu4rOU0sbCY596kFM1G48ucbuXs.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=35789ba1e156ee277121a73a4b3b936b42105919", "width": 320, "height": 640}, {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/OPtEY8_GYYzbMI5NNu4rOU0sbCY596kFM1G48ucbuXs.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a417727effe970a859c3d88c7127c1357a12628b", "width": 640, "height": 1280}], "variants": {}, "id": "j6y-Ukd1-1b2koGU___FlnMIC4DRoQ0Y282_qIIG5Xs"}], "enabled": false}, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "a952dea4-446e-11ea-9e22-0e78258713a3", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": "Satan is not a fucking pogo stick!", "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2ea6kj", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#d3d6da", "id": "1ju4tm5", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Direct-Caterpillar77", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 348, "send_replies": true, "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "permalink": "/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/comments/1ju4tm5/how_do_i_31f_tell_my_colleague_44f_her_behaviour/", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/comments/1ju4tm5/how_do_i_31f_tell_my_colleague_44f_her_behaviour/", "subreddit_subscribers": 3841410, "created_utc": 1744085041.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}], "before": null}}}
