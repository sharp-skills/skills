There is no HR department or anything like that, it\u2019s just the owner, me, and another worker. The owner\u2019s wife (who has a full-time job so we never see her) manages the finances; I\u2019ll call her Jane.\n\nMy colleague and I keep receiving emails from Jane with no greeting/salutation and an overly aggressive tone, and every time we send our invoices to get paid for the previous period\u2019s work, they\u2019re met with sarcastic comments and payment is consistently late.\n\nMost of her emails contain general complaints and stress about money. To be clear, we have zero access to the accounts and we haven\u2019t spent any money, but we will bring up items that have run low, are requested by customers, or need to be replenished to our boss. Boss spends money without discussing it with her. We think perhaps she is taking this out on us. We keep replying to emails saying \u201cplease discuss with Boss directly,\u201d but they keep on coming.\n\nFor example, after I sent my September invoice to her (and cc\u2019d Boss) as usual for the previous month\u2019s work and said, \u201cHi Jane, please find attached invoice xyz for September. Kind regards, me.\u201d (The invoice details each day I worked and what was done, rate and taxes, etc.) She wrote back: \u201cWhat is this for exactly???\u201d I wrote back (as always, cc\u2019ing my boss): \u201cIt\u2019s for my work during September. Any issues or concerns, please contact me, happy to clarify.\u201d Her response: \u201cWe DO NOT have money growing on trees here. Explain to me why I should shell out money?\u201d\n\nAfter some back and forth of polite explaining that we have a contract and it is services in exchange for money, Boss asked her to pay it ASAP, and she then wrote back to me: \u201cWe have a LOT of bills. Just yesterday you asked me to pay for ink for the printer which I can\u2019t do because my son is going to soccer camp and I have expenses happening there. And now you send me this and &lt;colleague\u2019s name&gt; also sent me a bill. We are going overseas in December but thanks to you it looks like we\u2019ll have to cancel because we can\u2019t afford it. You are increasing our spendage, we want to be decreasing it.\u201d\n\nTo clarify, I am working once a week for agreed upon hours and I work through lunch and work late without payment because we are so understaffed. I am only billing for my time; any business purchases go through them.\n\nThen, after I sent October\u2019s invoice a month later, she said: \u201cI\u2019m not sure if you\u2019re a slow learner, but I\u2019ve told you already we don\u2019t need increased monthly bills and we are looking to reduce not increase costs.\u201d\n\nAnother example from last week: \u201cCall and tell them I WILL NOT be paying the $1400 bill from Boss\u2019s phone.\u00a0Apparently he went over plan limit. Well I won\u2019t pay it.\u201d\n\nI showed Boss, and he apologized for her rudeness and asked me to call telephone company and get back to Jane. My email: \u201cHi Jane and Boss, I\u2019ve followed up your invoice with as requested. Attached is a list of all the calls and data used that explains the charges. They suggested you might want to look at moving up to a larger data plan. I asked on your behalf, but they won\u2019t waive your bill unfortunately because there hasn\u2019t been any error on their part, the data did go well over the limit of your current plan and they did send automatic SMS notifications to let you know. They\u2019ve also warned that as the bill payment is so late, if the invoice isn\u2019t paid in the next seven days that they\u2019ll switch off the service to the phone.\u201d\n\nThe phone got cancelled and she wrote to me and colleague: \u201cUseless. Both of you.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s your advice on how to communicate that we really don\u2019t want to be involved in their personal finance discussions and that her emails upset us to the point of interrupting our flow of work, we both leave the office feeling super down in the dumps, and it\u2019s slowly chipping away at our motivation to be there?\n\nObviously, something needs to be done because this is festering for us both. Is it best to bring it up with our boss? He is likely to brush it off and tell us to ignore her. Both of them? We love working there, love our customers, and are working hard for them and both put in unpaid overtime most weeks because we care about the work we do.\n\nBoss claims wife Jane is just moody. We both need the jobs and money (both single parents and flexible job options in Australia are not easy to come by) but it seems in any other normal company, you could take these emails to HR. What do you do when there\u2019s no HR department and you\u2019re not an employee?\n\n[Update](https://www.askamanager.org/2016/03/update-my-bosss-wife-is-rude-and-insulting-and-were-forced-to-deal-with-her.html)  **March 17, 2016 (5 months later)**\n\nIt\u2019s been a very crazy situation, so I\u2019m sorry to have taken so long to send this. I feel like I\u2019ve only just gotten over it properly this last week.\n\nThanks again for your and everyone else\u2019s advice. I showed it to my coworker. We have both since quit and are working at other jobs. YIPPEE! I must say, the \u201cnormal\u201d of working with people that are respectful, work hard and aren\u2019t compete weirdos was really startling to both of us at first (in a very good way)! Seriously, I pinch myself each day and feel extremely lucky.\n\nSo, what happened after I wrote in is we had a meeting: Jane, Boss, Coworker, and I. Coworker and I called the meeting and they reluctantly agreed to have it. We thought the meeting actually went okay at first! (We were wrong.) We came prepared for the meeting \u2013 brought in figures, our work hours, Jane\u2019s rude emails printed out, evidence of the increasing workload, and customer comments/feedback and suggested we collaboratively come up with a plan and set of values (for lack of better word) around how we could all work together in 2016, go through everyone\u2019s issues, the money stuff, how we would treat and speak to each other, how we\u2019d all agree to behave, and what we\u2019d commit to do as a company (e.g. answer emails within 48 hours, etc). We printed a calendar of the whole year to plan the goals they wanted to work towards each month. I\u2019m embarrassed to say we both naively thought this could be a positive meeting.\n\nBoss was very strange around Jane (his wife). She went through the figures, expressed amazement at how good they looked, apologised for her emails, it was all going okay-ish until Boss cut her off mid-sentence and told her to \u201cokay just be quiet now, you\u2019re babbling, Jane!\u201d\n\nI think my jaw actually dropped when Jane retreated into her shell and didn\u2019t say anything. Keep in mind, Boss is usually charming and laissez faire about everything and Jane is usually aggressive and quick to anger.\n\nWe\u2019ve never seen this side of him. Or her. He turned in a split second. Emotional abuse much?\n\nShe then very quietly fobbed off the planning and said she wasn\u2019t interested and Boss could go through this on a work day, not today perhaps. Boss said,\u201d Oh, don\u2019t you f**king tell me what to do, Jane!\u201d then said he was going out for lunch because he was bored of the meeting.\u00a0He left and then Coworker, Jane, and I were still sitting around the table (in shock). Jane apologised again and said she was under major stress because Boss could not handle money well and getting them into a lot of debt.\u00a0We said it was nothing to do with us and if they couldn\u2019t afford to pay us then they shouldn\u2019t have staff.\n\nJane kept apologising over and over about her emails and said she hadn\u2019t thought before she typed and she was angry at Boss and acknowledged she shouldn\u2019t take it out on us. She then launched into inadequacies of Boss, how lazy he is, how he spends all her money, how he\u2019s irresponsible and selfish\u2026\u00a0Coworker and I were very wary and just listened and kept moving towards the door. We know better than to get involved in a married couple\u2019s relationship issues. We honestly said nothing, just said some vague hmmmms in response, and got the hell out of there as soon as we could.\n\nWe left together and were happy Jane had communicated with us and felt we had a bit more understanding of where she was coming from (and that she knew she had behaved unacceptably). The next work day, we came in and started replying to and calling customers. Boss said good morning, was bumbling along, sitting there watching YouTube videos of racing cars as usual for about 20 minutes or so, and suddenly he paused the video, swivelled around in his chair, and the side of him we saw at the meeting was out again. He started shouting and swearing at us saying HOW F**KING DARE WE speak about him to Jane behind his back. HOW DARE WE say X, Y, Z about him (it was actually Jane who\u00a0said XYZ about him being lazy, not us). HOW DARE WE continue the meeting without him present. Coworker burst into tears and I would have too but I was too shocked! He kept going, really a monster and verbally abusive. We were backed into our work corner too and he was blocking the exit (not stopping us from going or anything, but when someone is shouting like that, it\u2019s quite threatening in atmosphere not to be able to reach an exit). We calmly eventually got out that we didn\u2019t say anything, that Jane said all those things and we just sat and listened, and he started going off again saying he spoke to her and she said we had said all those things about him.\n\nI packed up my things, left the office key on the desk, said \u201cexcuse me\u201d as I pushed past him, and walked out and so did Coworker, to him yelling at us in the background: WHERE THE F**K DO YOU THINK YOU\u2019RE GOING?! COME BACK HERE RIGHT NOW, HOW DARE YOU LEAVE, YOU DON\u2019T HAVE MY PERMISSION TO LEAVE\u2026 etc etc. It was quite scary, to be honest, but in the moment it kind of seemed comical and I felt pity for them. I couldn\u2019t stop worrying about the customers though and what would happen there, but self preservation got me out of there!\n\nSo all these years, under the casual and relaxed persona of Boss has been a psychopath and behind Jane\u2019s cross-ness/rudeness is an emotionally/verbally abused woman acting out her bottled up anger. And we\u2019re pretty sure she threw us under the bus in her place when they talked after the meeting to save her marriage. Equally scary and sad.\n\nSo Luxury Teapot Company has sadly now closed. I know some readers suggested Coworker and I buy it (we wish!) but the asking price is around AUD$8 million. Yes, really!\n\nThey replaced both of us four times since January (so, eight different people) and couldn\u2019t get anyone to stay \u2013 while Jane was apparently very nice to them they all complained about Boss being lazy and not managing and the workload being ridiculous \u2013 they couldn\u2019t find anyone willing to do the extra hours we had for free. They begged us both to come back but there\u2019s no way in hell. We called Fair Work Australia because surely his behaviour is illegal, but they weren\u2019t particularly helpful and nothing went any further. We\u2019re both just happy to be out of there.\n\nSo it closed down a few weeks ago because Jane doesn\u2019t have time to answer and service and schedule the customers as she works full-time with a lot of overtime and Boss refuses to answer emails or answer the business phone, so without staff the customers go unanswered and no bookings get made. And no one has a spare $8 million hanging around to buy the business. I feel very sorry for the lovely customers that had booked and now are trying to get their deposits back from Boss and Jane, and I\u2019m still getting calls about it on my personal mobile phone. I do feel a little responsible, but I just couldn\u2019t stay there.\n\nThank you again, Alison, for your and everyone else\u2019s advice. It got both Coworker and I out of the fog and crazyland and things are so, so much better now. Totally and utterly relieved.\n\n**THIS IS A REPOST SUB - I AM NOT THE OOP** \n\n**DO NOT CONTACT THE OOP's OR COMMENT ON LINKED POSTS, REMEMBER - RULE 7**", "author_fullname": "t2_ikujf6ia", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "my boss\u2019s wife is rude and insulting, and we\u2019re forced to deal with her", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/BestofRedditorUpdates", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_1qdaidz", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "author_flair_background_color": "transparent", "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4979, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": "bd67c216-02aa-11ef-997e-76d955ea679c", "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "EXTERNAL", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 4979, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1768453322.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.BestofRedditorUpdates", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;my boss\u2019s wife is rude and insulting, and we\u2019re forced to deal with her&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Originally posted to Ask A Manager&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TRIGGER WARNING:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span class=\"md-spoiler-text\"&gt;Hostile workplace, verbal abuse, financial exploitation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.askamanager.org/2015/11/my-bosss-wife-is-rude-and-insulting-and-were-forced-to-deal-with-her.html\"&gt;Original Post&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;Nov 17, 2015&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I work for a small business with a home office on contract.

We\u2019re both just happy to be out of there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So it closed down a few weeks ago because Jane doesn\u2019t have time to answer and service and schedule the customers as she works full-time with a lot of overtime and Boss refuses to answer emails or answer the business phone, so without staff the customers go unanswered and no bookings get made. And no one has a spare $8 million hanging around to buy the business. I feel very sorry for the lovely customers that had booked and now are trying to get their deposits back from Boss and Jane, and I\u2019m still getting calls about it on my personal mobile phone. I do feel a little responsible, but I just couldn\u2019t stay there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you again, Alison, for your and everyone else\u2019s advice.

Demographers call it a crisis.** Politicians wring their hands. But few want to name the culprit staring them in the face: we have turned housing into a financial asset rather than a home, and the cost is measured in children never born.\n\n[https://medium.com/@hrnews1/new-study-global-fertility-rate-decline-now-linked-directly-to-the-commodification-of-housing-3e711414cf46](https://medium.com/@hrnews1/new-study-global-fertility-rate-decline-now-linked-directly-to-the-commodification-of-housing-3e711414cf46)\n\n# The Decline We Can Measure\n\nThe numbers are stark. From Sweden to Australia, from Japan to Brazil, young adults are postponing \u2014 or abandoning \u2014 parenthood. When researchers dig into the reasons, one factor emerges consistently across continents and income levels: housing.\n\n**Not as shelter, but as an economic burden so severe that it crowds out the space \u2014 financial, temporal, and psychological \u2014 needed to raise a family.**\n\nThe mechanism is simple and devastating. In the lowest income quintile across OECD countries, renters spend 30 to 40 percent of their income on housing alone. That\u2019s before childcare, education, food, or healthcare. The math doesn\u2019t work. And it hasn\u2019t worked for years.\n\n# How Housing Became an Investment \u2014 And Why That Matters\n\nThere\u2019s a crucial distinction between housing as shelter and housing as commodity. In the post-war era, particularly in Northern Europe and North America, housing was treated as a social good \u2014 built to be affordable, managed for stability, designed for families.\n\n**That world is largely gone.**\n\nToday, housing is treated primarily as an investment asset. Real estate companies, pension funds, and wealthy individuals bid up prices not to house people, but to generate returns. Zoning restrictions limit supply artificially.\n\nMortgage finance has become labyrinthine and expensive. Rental markets prioritize profit extraction over security or suitability for families. This is commodification: housing valued not by the shelter it provides, but by the wealth it promises to accumulate.\n\nThe consequences ripple through the entire life cycle of potential parents. A young couple cannot simply find an apartment they can afford. They must enter a speculative market where prices are driven as much by investment flows as by actual demand for homes.\n\nThey must choose between consuming their youth saving for a down payment or accepting decades of precarious renting. Neither path leads naturally toward children.\n\n# The Data Connection: When Housing Gets Unaffordable, Babies Don\u2019t Arrive\n\nThe research confirming this link is now substantial. In China, a 10 percent increase in the price-to-income ratio for housing correlated with a 0.42 percent drop in the likelihood of giving birth \u2014 a finding replicated across multiple studies examining the same relationship.\n\n**In Brazil,** lottery-based housing programs that provided secure housing to low-income families increased the probability of childbearing by 3.8 percent. The effect was especially pronounced among younger women, those most sensitive to housing insecurity.\n\n**In Japan,** the rising user cost of home ownership \u2014 encompassing purchase price, mortgage interest, and maintenance \u2014 showed a significantly negative relationship with fertility rates. In Bulgaria, regional variations in housing affordability directly correlated with fertility outcomes. The pattern is consistent: make housing more secure and affordable, and people have more children. Make it expensive and scarce, and they don\u2019t.\n\n**The Australian case is instructive**. In Sydney and Melbourne, where housing prices have soared fastest, fertility rates have collapsed more steeply than in less expensive regional areas. Young Australians in expensive cities are not choosing childlessness for cultural reasons; they are being priced out of it.\n\n# The Mechanisms: Why Housing Costs Destroy Fertility\n\n**The connection operates through several channels.** First, there is the simple income constraint. High housing costs leave less money for everything else \u2014 childcare, education, healthcare \u2014 that raising children requires. Parents cannot afford to live in neighborhoods with good schools while also paying for three children. The numbers simply don\u2019t align.\n\n**Second**, there is the risk aversion that housing instability breeds. Families living month-to-month in rental housing, unsure if they can afford next year\u2019s rent, are rationally reluctant to add dependents. Parenthood requires a sense of stability that commodified housing deliberately undermines.\n\n**Third,** there is opportunity cost. Young adults who might otherwise be forming partnerships and having children are instead channeling their energy, ambition, and savings into acquiring housing wealth or avoiding homelessness. A generation is delayed \u2014 first in moving out, then in partnering, then in having children. By the time housing becomes secure, many women have passed peak fertility years.\n\n**Fourth**, there are spatial effects. Young families cluster in expensive cities for job opportunities, only to discover that family-sized housing is unaffordable. They move back to cheaper regions but lose career mobility. The flexible, mobile workforce that modern economies supposedly prize is immobilized by the need to secure housing.[](https://buymeacoffee.com/hr_studios?source=post_page-----3e711414cf46---------------------------------------)\n\n# The Financialization Trap\n\nCommodification has a deeper dimension: the financialization of family life itself. In an earlier era, a young couple could reasonably expect to save, buy a modest home, and build a life.\n\nToday, the expectation is that housing is a wealth-building asset, that mortgages are complex financial instruments requiring expert navigation, that \u201chousing equity\u201d should serve as emergency savings, healthcare funding, and retirement plan all rolled into one.\n\nThis financialization makes housing decisions paramount. Buying the right property in the right neighborhood becomes not just about shelter but about securing financial future.\n\n**The anxiety this creates is profound.**\n\nAnd anxiety about housing is incompatible with the psychological security needed to commit to having children.\n\n# What This Means\n\nThe fertility collapse in the West is not primarily about women choosing careers over children, nor about cultural rejection of parenthood, nor about access to contraception.\n\nThese factors exist, but they explain only part of the story. The missing explanation \u2014 one that economists and policymakers have been reluctant to center \u2014 is that we have made housing so expensive, so insecure, and so financially burdensome that rational adults are choosing not to have children.\n\nThis is not inevitable.\n\nIt reflects a choice: the choice to treat housing as an investment vehicle for the wealthy rather than as infrastructure for human flourishing. Other choices are possible. Countries that have managed housing as a social good \u2014 providing secure, affordable housing as a matter of public policy \u2014 have maintained more stable fertility rates.\n\nThe data is clear. The mechanism is understood. The solution exists. What remains is the political will to remember that housing is, first and foremost, about providing homes for people to live in \u2014 and raise families.\n\nUntil we do, the birthrate will continue to fall. And in twenty years, we will wonder why.", "author_fullname": "t2_pje51xagh", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "New Study: Global Fertility Rate Decline Now Linked Directly to the Commodification of Housing", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/antiwork", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 116, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_1o85i7v", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3098, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": true, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": null, "can_mod_post": false, "score": 3098, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/3ulxQqWnY0HST7KU9VYekTxFuxbQ7tt8E4nrSTNCDVs.jpg", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "post_hint": "image", "content_categories": null, "is_self": false, "mod_note": null, "created": 1760619613.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "i.redd.it", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Germany, South Korea, and Italy, women are having fewer than 1.3 children on average \u2014 far below the 2.1 needed to maintain a stable population.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Across the OECD, fertility has plummeted from 3.3 children per woman in 1960 to just 1.5 today.

Neither path leads naturally toward children.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;The Data Connection: When Housing Gets Unaffordable, Babies Don\u2019t Arrive&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The research confirming this link is now substantial. In China, a 10 percent increase in the price-to-income ratio for housing correlated with a 0.42 percent drop in the likelihood of giving birth \u2014 a finding replicated across multiple studies examining the same relationship.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In Brazil,&lt;/strong&gt; lottery-based housing programs that provided secure housing to low-income families increased the probability of childbearing by 3.8 percent. The effect was especially pronounced among younger women, those most sensitive to housing insecurity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In Japan,&lt;/strong&gt; the rising user cost of home ownership \u2014 encompassing purchase price, mortgage interest, and maintenance \u2014 showed a significantly negative relationship with fertility rates. In Bulgaria, regional variations in housing affordability directly correlated with fertility outcomes. The pattern is consistent: make housing more secure and affordable, and people have more children. Make it expensive and scarce, and they don\u2019t.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Australian case is instructive&lt;/strong&gt;. In Sydney and Melbourne, where housing prices have soared fastest, fertility rates have collapsed more steeply than in less expensive regional areas. Young Australians in expensive cities are not choosing childlessness for cultural reasons; they are being priced out of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;The Mechanisms: Why Housing Costs Destroy Fertility&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The connection operates through several channels.&lt;/strong&gt; First, there is the simple income constraint. High housing costs leave less money for everything else \u2014 childcare, education, healthcare \u2014 that raising children requires. Parents cannot afford to live in neighborhoods with good schools while also paying for three children. The numbers simply don\u2019t align.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Second&lt;/strong&gt;, there is the risk aversion that housing instability breeds. Families living month-to-month in rental housing, unsure if they can afford next year\u2019s rent, are rationally reluctant to add dependents. Parenthood requires a sense of stability that commodified housing deliberately undermines.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Third,&lt;/strong&gt; there is opportunity cost. Young adults who might otherwise be forming partnerships and having children are instead channeling their energy, ambition, and savings into acquiring housing wealth or avoiding homelessness. A generation is delayed \u2014 first in moving out, then in partnering, then in having children. By the time housing becomes secure, many women have passed peak fertility years.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fourth&lt;/strong&gt;, there are spatial effects. Young families cluster in expensive cities for job opportunities, only to discover that family-sized housing is unaffordable. They move back to cheaper regions but lose career mobility. The flexible, mobile workforce that modern economies supposedly prize is immobilized by the need to secure housing.&lt;a href=\"https://buymeacoffee.com/hr_studios?source=post_page-----3e711414cf46---------------------------------------\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;The Financialization Trap&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Commodification has a deeper dimension: the financialization of family life itself. In an earlier era, a young couple could reasonably expect to save, buy a modest home, and build a life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Today, the expectation is that housing is a wealth-building asset, that mortgages are complex financial instruments requiring expert navigation, that \u201chousing equity\u201d should serve as emergency savings, healthcare funding, and retirement plan all rolled into one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This financialization makes housing decisions paramount. Buying the right property in the right neighborhood becomes not just about shelter but about securing financial future.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The anxiety this creates is profound.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And anxiety about housing is incompatible with the psychological security needed to commit to having children.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;What This Means&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The fertility collapse in the West is not primarily about women choosing careers over children, nor about cultural rejection of parenthood, nor about access to contraception.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These factors exist, but they explain only part of the story. The missing explanation \u2014 one that economists and policymakers have been reluctant to center \u2014 is that we have made housing so expensive, so insecure, and so financially burdensome that rational adults are choosing not to have children.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is not inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It reflects a choice: the choice to treat housing as an investment vehicle for the wealthy rather than as infrastructure for human flourishing. Other choices are possible. Countries that have managed housing as a social good \u2014 providing secure, affordable housing as a matter of public policy \u2014 have maintained more stable fertility rates.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The data is clear. The mechanism is understood. The solution exists. What remains is the political will to remember that housing is, first and foremost, about providing homes for people to live in \u2014 and raise families.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Until we do, the birthrate will continue to fall. And in twenty years, we will wonder why.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "url_overridden_by_dest": "https://i.redd.it/majy5v8q1hvf1.png", "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "preview": {"images": [{"source": {"url": "https://preview.redd.it/majy5v8q1hvf1.png?auto=webp&amp;s=f0117df07981c0a582a28bc6e6baefb02a66d254", "width": 935, "height": 778}, "resolutions": [{"url": "https://preview.redd.it/majy5v8q1hvf1.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f649de9f31bc0b4ec2376ca9635aa357780c227b", "width": 108, "height": 89}, {"url": "https://preview.redd.it/majy5v8q1hvf1.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f6a3f1ac77b50fd997b8d3e03a0f566b0185d745", "width": 216, "height": 179}, {"url": "https://preview.redd.it/majy5v8q1hvf1.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=863207cf0b07e8f61c6238550596b38091e1c51a", "width": 320, "height": 266}, {"url": "https://preview.redd.it/majy5v8q1hvf1.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=da9866f306fa669ea5fa0e0901f75362cfea4d40", "width": 640, "height": 532}], "variants": {}, "id": "j7SPEQlOWR9No91pOZdcxUQy8wusv_julTVRq4H4utQ"}], "enabled": true}, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2y77d", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "1o85i7v", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "thehomelessr0mantic", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 117, "send_replies": true, "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/antiwork/comments/1o85i7v/new_study_global_fertility_rate_decline_now/", "stickied": false, "url": "https://i.redd.it/majy5v8q1hvf1.png", "subreddit_subscribers": 2939519, "created_utc": 1760619613.0, "num_crossposts": 3, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "StremioAddons", "selftext": "# \ud83c\udfac [STREMIO FULL &amp; EASY TOTAL BEGINNER'S GUIDE](https://luckynumb3rs.github.io/stremio-perfect-setup/) [v1.1]\n\n[Homescreen \\(left\\) &amp; Stream source selection \\(right\\)](https://preview.redd.it/xd3jbgpapmig1.png?width=1969&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e86a2a31ec23d327873dd90364f6c364eb536880)\n\n**\u2728 NEW: Check out the extended guide with screenshots [**HERE**](https://luckynumb3rs.github.io/stremio-perfect-setup/).**\n\nAfter a few iterations trying out what works and what doesn't for me, and testing various add-ons, I think I have reached the optimal Stremio setup. Of course it's a matter of taste and everyone has different preferences, but I will share my guide here for anyone interested, or at least get started easily and then modify in reverse whatever changes they want. So here it is completely from scratch:\n\n**Don't be scared. Although it may look like a very long guide, it's actually just a few simple steps and very easy. I just wanted to be thorough and describe everything totally step-by-step so you understand what you're doing.**\n\n**If this guide helps you, please upvote this post so it remains relevant for others to find it and also benefit from it. \ud83d\ude0a**\n\n&gt;**NOTES**:\n&gt;* *If you already followed this guide and would like to **update to the latest template** (check out the version number on the title), go to [**\ud83d\udd14 Updates**](https://luckynumb3rs.github.io/stremio-perfect-setup/guide/Updates) on the extended guide.*\n&gt;* ***If you followed this guide and are encountering issues or have configuration questions**, go to [**\u2753 Configuration Q&amp;A**](https://luckynumb3rs.github.io/stremio-perfect-setup/guide/8-Configuration-QA) on the extended guide.

Accounts Preparation\n\nFirst, let's start by creating the accounts (those who already have them can skip these steps):\n\n1. Obviously, start by creating a new free [**Stremio**](https://www.stremio.com) account.\n2. Choose a Debrid service for caching the torrents, create an account on it, buy a subscription, and get the API key.\n   * *This is optional, but HIGHLY recommended.*\n   * *For those who don't know, this is the only thing you will be paying for (about 32\u20ac for Real-Debrid or $33 for TorBox for 12 months). It's used as an intermediary to serve the files to you from their servers, instead of relying on torrent which may be slow and inefficient. This means faster loading, almost no buffering, and more high-quality stream options. I would definitely recommend getting this.*\n   * *I use mainly* [***TorBox***](https://torbox.app/subscription?referral=4f317900-e517-47f3-a62b-f094ec06e851), as a backup I use [***Real-Debrid***](http://real-debrid.com/?id=8801126) *(these are referral links since we're at it :), two of the best platforms, with the best prices and very stable.*\n   * *For **TorBox**, please make sure to use my referral code when ordering: **4f317900-e517-47f3-a62b-f094ec06e851** to get 7 additional days for each month you buy (only for the first purchase, so I recommend you go big from the start and buy the yearly, it's a better value and you get 84 additional days for free). You can also buy the cheapest tier for a year initially to get the extra 3 months, and if you need a higher tier, you can upgrade along the way, it is possible. **IMPORTANT**: When you're on the subscription plans page, scroll down to the bottom and you'll see a field (not the \"Coupon Code\" field just below the plans, but to the very bottom of the page) where you can enter my code (not to be confused with the \"Your referral code is:\" part above it) and click **Submit**. Then you can proceed with buying your chosen plan.*\n   * *To help you choose between Real-Debrid and TorBox:*\n      * ***Real-Debrid** is one of the most widely used service, and has probably the largest cache (files already available on their servers and ready to watch) of shows and movies. However, they only allow one connection at a time, meaning that you can't watch on two or more devices simultaneously (you can log in to your Stremio account on as many devices you want, that's unrelated). So if you want to use it with friends or family or on multiple Stremio accounts to watch simultaneously, you can't: you'll get a warning and may risk getting banned if repeated.*\n      * ***TorBox** allows in it's most basic paid option up to 3 parallel connections, and has tiers with up to 10 parallel streams, which means that you can use the same API key for e.g. your entire family or friends, or multiple Stremio accounts. However, it may not have the large cache of readily available shows like Real-Debrid has, so it might happen that you cannot watch a show immediately because it needs to download it first (you see that in the source links marked with an hourglass icon. This may take time depending on the seeders available, but it's also usually fast). It usually has more than enough options cached for each show though, and you only need one :).*\n      * *The choice is yours. TorBox would be very practical and cheaper for multiple screens or families, but Real-Debrid would MAYBE provide more immediately available options. I myself use **both** (you can enable both in AIOStreams, and considering the prices for both, it's still cheap): I use TorBox as my main, because my family can safely use it simultaneously, and I also keep a backup Real-Debrid, in case it may happen that Real-Debrid has a result that TorBox doesn't immediately have (always keeping in mind though that Real-Debrid only allows 1 connection, hence as a backup only).*\n   * *ONLY AFTER you registered to one or both services from the links above and subscribed to a plan (and paid for it), you can get the **API key** while logged in to your account directly on [**this**](https://real-debrid.com/apitoken) link for Real-Debrid or [**here**](https://torbox.app/settings?section=account) for TorBox.*\n3. Create a free [**Trakt**](http://www.trakt.tv) account.\n   * *This is recommended for tracking what you watch, and getting some custom lists. Makes the Stremio experience more like Netflix. If your account is new, rate or mark as watched at least 10 movies and 10 shows, it will be good for creating custom lists later below, otherwise they won't work.*\n4. Create a [**TMDB**](https://www.themoviedb.org/) account and get a free API key:\n   * *TMDB is used for the metadata (descriptions, cast, etc.) of Movies.*\n   1. Click on your profile icon on the top right and click on \"**Settings**\".\n   2. Click \"**API**\".\n   3. In the \"**Request an API Key**\" click on \"*To generate a new API key, click here*\".\n   4. Click \"**Yes**\" when asked \"*Is the intended use of our API for personal use?*\".\n   5. Fill the form with whatever info (doesn't have to be correct), and click \"**Subscribe**\".\n   6. When successful, you will get taken to a page that reads \"*You are currently on the Free Developer plan.*\", and click on \"**Access your API key details here**\".\n   7. Copy the \"**API Read Access Token**\" and the \"**API Key**\".\n5. Create a [**TVDB**](https://www.thetvdb.com/) account and get a free API key:\n   * *TVDB is used for the metadata (descriptions, cast, etc.) of Series.*\n   1. After being logged in to the account, go to [**this**](https://www.thetvdb.com/api-information) page.\n   2. Select any options from the checklist that shows and click \"**Save**\".\n   3. Click \"**Get Started**\".\n   4. Make sure \"**Less than $50k per year**\" is selected in \"*Company / Project Revenue*\", fill the rest with whatever info (doesn't have to be correct), and click \"**Submit**\".\n   5. Copy the API key that is shown on the \"*API Signup Success*\" page.\n6. Create a **Google/Gmail** account if you don't have one, and get a free **Gemini** API key:\n   * *Optional, but recommended for AI searches, to search not only for movie or show names, but also e.g. \"movies like Batman\" or more complex searches.*\n   1. When logged in to your Google account, go to [**Google AI Studio**](https://aistudio.google.com/api-keys).\n   2. Accept the agreement if it's your first time opening it, by enabling the checkbox and clicking \"**Continue**\".\n   3. An API key should normally get created automatically on the list, called \"**Default Gemini API Key**\".\n   4. Click on the clickable link on the \"**Key**\" column, and copy the \"**API Key**\".\n   * *If no key is created automatically, just create one by clicking \"Create API Key\" on the top right.*\n7. (**Optional**) Totally optional and not a must at all, but if Trakt feels limiting with its rate limits or you want more curated lists, check out these friendly alternatives that work great with AIOMetadata:\n   * **MDBList**: Perfect for discovering user-curated catalogs and tracking your watched content seamlessly.\n   * **Simkl**: A Trakt-like experience with check-ins and watch history, plus extra flexibility.\n   * You can use them alongside Trakt or as a replacement for a smoother, more personalized setup.\n   * Head to [**\ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Additional Stuff**](https://luckynumb3rs.github.io/stremio-perfect-setup/guide/7-Additional-Stuff/#enriching-your-catalogs-trakt-alternatives) on the extended guide for easy setup steps.\n\n---\n\n# \u2699\ufe0f 2. Stremio Account Initialization\n\nSecond, let's prepare the Stremio account properly:\n\n1. Open [**Stremio Web**](https://web.stremio.com) and **MAKE SURE** you're signed in with your account.\n   * **IMPORTANT**: *Do not confuse* [*www.stremio.com*](https://www.stremio.com)*, which is for account management, with* [*web.stremio.com*](https://web.stremio.com)*, which you **MUST** be signed in to for removing/installing the addons. Being signed in to* [*www.stremio.com*](https://www.stremio.com) *does not automatically sign you in to* [*web.stremio.com*](https://web.stremio.com)*, and your addons will not install on your account.*\n   * *Obviously you need a browser to configure everything on this guide, including using the **Web** version of Stremio to remove and install addons. Don't worry though, after you set everything up **ONCE**, you can use your setup everywhere you use Stremio (Smart TV, Android, iOS, Windows, everywhere).*\n2. Go to \"**Settings**\" in [**Stremio Account**](https://www.stremio.com) and enable **Trakt Scrobbling** by connecting it to your Trakt account.\n   * *This will allow Stremio to sync show progress and history with Trakt.*\n3. Go to \"**Addons**\" and uninstall all addons.\n   * *Also remove the **Trakt Integration** addon, it is separate from **Trakt Scrobbling** (which you need), and you don't need it because we will use something else for this.*\n   * *Cinemeta and Local Files cannot be removed. Leave them, we will take care of this later.*\n\n---\n\n# \ud83d\udcda 3. AIOStreams [Find Streams]\n\n**AIOStreams** is the stream aggregation engine in this setup. It combines multiple scraping sources into one consistent results list, and lets you apply filtering, sorting, and formatting so the best links appear first.\n\nSelect an **AIOStreams** instance from [**this**](https://status.stremio-status.com/) or [**this**](https://status.dinsden.top/status/stremio-addons) link (they both show the same instances and their online status, it's just two different sources) and:\n\n* ***WARNING**:*\n   * *If you want to understand more what an instance means, go to [**\ud83d\udd30 Beginner Concepts**](https://luckynumb3rs.github.io/stremio-perfect-setup/guide/0-Beginner-Concepts/#what-does-an-addon-instance-mean) on the extended guide.*\n   * *[**Midnight's**](https://aiostreamsfortheweebsstable.midnightignite.me/) or [**Yeb's**](https://aiostreams.fortheweak.cloud/) are some of the most popular, so you can use these links directly, but almost all are viable options.*\n   * *If you go with **Yeb's**, **DON'T** use the old [aiostreamsfortheweak.nhyira.dev](https://aiostreamsfortheweak.nhyira.dev/) link, but [aiostreams.fortheweak.cloud](https://aiostreams.fortheweak.cloud/), as linked right above.*\n   * ***DON'T** choose an instance that says **Nightly**, since they may not be stable.*\n   * ***DON'T** choose the **ElfHosted** instance because Torrentio doesn't work there.*\n   * *Choose one of the instances and stick with it, you will store your configuration here, and if you change to the other instance, you'll need to do it again because it's not automatically transferred*\n   * *You can keep the monitoring links above for later to check the instance online status, if it happens that it's not working and might be temporarily down.*\n\n1. Select \"**Advanced**\" on the welcome screen if it shows up.\n2. Copy [**this**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/luckynumb3rs/stremio-perfect-setup/refs/heads/main/templates/AIOStreams.json) link (right-click and \"*Copy link address*\").\n3. Go to the \"**Save &amp; Install**\" tab on AIOStreams (sidebar menu on the left), click \"**Import**\", \"**Import Template**\", paste the link you copied and click on \"**Go**\".\n4. Click \"**Use this Template Now**\".\n5. On the \"**Select Services**\" page that is shown, enable the Debrid services you want to use (or click \"*Skip*\" if you don't use any), and click \"**Next**\".\n6. On the \"**Enter Credentials**\" page, enter all API keys you prepared earlier.\n   * For **RPDB**, unless you have an account and a paid subscription with your own API key, you can also use the free standard API Key \"*t0-free-rpdb*\" directly.\n7. Click on \"**Load Template**\".\n8. **Optional**: At this point AIOStreams is ready, but you can keep configuring it however you like. For example, if you want to further configure the scrapers or subtitle languages, you can go to the \"**Installed Addons**\" tab, where you will see:\n   * *You can configure each of them with the Pencil button on the right if needed.*\n   1. **Torrentio, StremThru, Comet, MediaFusion, Jackettio** are the scrapers finding the sources.\n   2. **SeaDex and AnimeTosho** are for Anime and initially disabled. **If you want Anime results** you need to enable these.\n   3. **Nuvio Streams** and **WebStreamr** are HTTP scrapers that provide direct web streams, initially disabled. you can use these if you don't/can't use debrid and/or torrents. They may be more limited in quality and availability, but are a good alternative.\n   4. **SubHero** is for the subtitles, you can edit the languages and any other subtitle preferences here.\n   * ***SeaDex**, **AnimeTosho**, and **Jackettio** need a debrid service, so if not using one, you need to disable them.*\n   * *If you want to have a language other than English to show first on the results list, go to **Filters** tab, then **Language**, and add your language to the **Preferred Languages** list, and put it first in the **Preference Order** list. You can also add the language in the **Required Languages** to ONLY show streams in that language, but keep in mind that streams that might have no language tags at all or tagged as \"multi\" will not be shown.*\n   * *If you want to take it a step further and totally prioritize your language, even before Quality and Resolution, then go to the **Sorting** tab, select **Cached** on the **Sort Order Type** dropdown menu, and on the **Order** section, move **Language** to the top or wherever you want to have it. Do this also for the **Uncached** sort order type.*\n9. Go to the \"**Save &amp; Install**\" tab, enter a password on the \"**Create Configuration**\" section, and click \"**Create**\".\n   * **ALWAYS SAVE IN THIS TAB EVERY TIME YOU MAKE CHANGES LATER.**\n   * *Copy and store the **UUID** that is shown and the **Password** you set for later to access the configuration again. This is basically your AIOStreams account.*\n   * *If you can't save the configuration with the error \"Jackettio requires a debrid service\", which happens in case you are not using any debrids, then just uninstall Jackettio from the \"Installed Addons\" tab.*\n   * *If you can't save the configuration with errors like \"Jackettio/SeaDex/AnimeTosho requires a debrid service...\", which happens in case you are not using any debrids, then just disable Jackettio, SeaDex, and AnimeTosho from the \"Installed Addons\" tab. If you watch Anime, the other scrapers might still find results, but SeaDex and AnimeTosho increase the chances. You do need a debrid service to use them though.*\n10. Click \"**Install**\" and install the add-on on Stremio.\n\n* ***NOTE FOR LATER:***\n   * *If you see that you are getting results too slowly, try changing the fetching strategy. Go to **Addons**, scroll down to **Addon Fetching Strategy**. and select **Dynamic**. There should already be an exit condition pre-filled, which you can leave as is, and save the configuration. However, keep in mind that this might leave out relevant results, so try it yourself. On the other hand, if you feel you're not getting enough good results, do the opposite and select **Default** instead.*\n   * *If you prefer results for a language other than English, and you are not happy with the results you're getting, try disabling matching. Go to **Filters**, then **Matching**, and switch off the **Enable** toggle in all three sections (Title Matching, Year Matching, Season/Episode Matching).*\n\n---\n\n# \ud83d\udd0e 4. AIOMetadata [Metadata &amp; Catalogs]\n\n**AIOMetadata** is the metadata and catalogs layer. It improves discovery by powering richer catalogs, search behavior, and integrations, so browsing titles in Stremio feels more complete and organized.\n\nSelect an **AIOMetdata** instance from [**this**](https://status.stremio-status.com/) or [**this**](https://status.dinsden.top/status/stremio-addons) link (they both show the same instances and their online status, it's just two different sources) and:\n\n* ***WARNING**:*\n   * *If you want to understand more what an instance means, go to [**\ud83d\udd30 Beginner Concepts**](https://luckynumb3rs.github.io/stremio-perfect-setup/guide/0-Beginner-Concepts/#what-does-an-addon-instance-mean) on the extended guide.*\n   * *[**Viren's**](https://aiometadata.viren070.me/) or [**Midnight's**](https://aiometadatafortheweebs.midnightignite.me/) are some of the most popular, so you can use these links directly, but almost all are viable options.*\n   * ***Yeb's** and **Kuu's** are not working with Trakt currently because Trakt has imposed strict rate limits lately, so **DON'T** use these instances for now.*\n   * *Choose one of the instances and stick with it, you will store your configuration here, and if you change to the other instance, you'll need to configure it again because it's not automatically transferred.*\n   * *You can keep the monitoring links above for later to check the instance online status, if it happens that it's not working and might be temporarily down.*\n\n1. Download my configuration file [**here**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/luckynumb3rs/stremio-perfect-setup/refs/heads/main/templates/AIOMetadata.json) (right-click, \"*Save As*\", and save it as `.json`, not `.txt`).\n2. Go to the \"**Configuration**\" tab, click on \"**Import Configuration**\", and load my configuration file.\n3. Go to the \"**Integrations**\" tab, and enter the API keys for Gemini, TMDB, TheTVDB, RPDB.\n   * *For **RPDB**, unless you have an account and a paid subscription with your own API key, you can also use the free standard API Key \"t0-free-rpdb\" directly.*\n4. Go to the \"**Catalogs**\" tab, and near the \"Quick Add\" button, you will see the **Trakt** icon. Click on it and follow the steps to connect your Trakt account.\n   * ***NOTES***: \n      * *If you encounter any issues with Trakt integration on AIOMetadata, it's probably because Trakt is rate limiting the instance you're using, or the instance provider has disabled it (if it says \"Instance owner has not yet set up the Trakt integration.\"). In that case, try to do the AIOMetadata setup with another instance.*\n      * *Alternatively, you can leave Trakt integration disabled, and hide the Trakt catalogs on the list (marked with a red **Trakt** tag on the right) by clicking the green eye icon for each. I know it's not ideal since you created a Trakt account already, but there's nothing we can do about it. You can still add other catalogs from the other sources there.*\n      * *There are also good alternatives to Trakt if you disable it, both for watch history tracking, and curated catalogs, which you can check out in [**\ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Additional Stuff**](https://luckynumb3rs.github.io/stremio-perfect-setup/guide/7-Additional-Stuff/#enriching-your-catalogs-trakt-alternatives) on the extended guide.*\n   * *If you want some ready-to-use and well-maintained lists, while on the Trakt tab, search for the lists from user \"snoak\", and you will be able to import a lot of interesting lists. I have already included some of them in the catalog, but you can add more.*\n   * **For Anime users**: *If you want to enable search for Anime, make sure to go to to the \"Search\" tab and enable both \"Anime Search Engine\" switches.*\n   * **For other languages**: *If you want the metadata (descriptions, titles, etc.) to show in a different language than English, go to the \"General\" tab and change the \"Display Language\".*\n5. **Optional**: At this point AIOMetadata is ready, but you can keep configuring it however you like, but otherwise the configuration I provided is ready to be used. On the \"**Catalogs**\" tab you can add, remove, enable, disable catalogs depending on your preferences.\n6. Go to the \"**Configuration**\" tab again and click on \"**Save Configuration**\".\n   * **ALWAYS SAVE IN THIS TAB EVERY TIME YOU MAKE CHANGES LATER.**\n   * *Copy and store the **UUID** that is shown and the **Password** you set for later to access the configuration again. This is basically your AIOMetadata account.*\n7. Click \"**Install**\" and install the add-on on Stremio.\n   * *If you get a \"AddonsPushedToAPI Max descriptor size reached\" error when installing, you probably have too many catalogs on AIOMetadata. Disable some, save the configuration, and try to install it again.*\n   * *If you didn't want to get an API key for Gemini, go to the **Search** tab and disable **AI-Powered Search** to be able to save.*\n\n* ***NOTE FOR LATER:***\n   * *Keep in mind that if you want to change catalogs after you have installed AIOMetadata on Stremio, you need to refresh the installation, otherwise the catalogs with not show. You do that with Cinebye below.*\n\n---\n\n# \ud83e\uddf9 5. Cinebye [Clean-Up]\n\nGo to [**this**](https://cinebye.elfhosted.com/) **Cinebye** instance and:\n\n1. Sign in with your Stremio account details.\n   1. OR if you don't want to use your credentials directly, there is a more complicated approach:\n   2. Login to [**Stremio Web**](https://web.stremio.com/) using your credentials in your browser.\n   3. Open the developer console (F12 on Chrome) and paste this code snippet: `JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem(\"profile\")).auth.key`\n   4. Take the output value and paste it in Cinebye where it says \"*Paste Stremio AuthKey here...*\".\n   5. Press **Enter** or click **Login**.\n2. Once authenticated and the options become available, in section \"**2 - Options**\" you can download a backup first just to be safe.\n3. Enable all three patches: \"**Remove Cinemeta Search**\", \"**Remove Cinemeta Catalogs**\", and \"**Remove Cinemeta Metadata**\".\n4. Scroll down to \"**Manage Addons**\" and change the order of the add-ons to this:\n   1. *Cinemeta*\n   2. *AIOMetadata*\n   3. *AIOStreams*\n   4. *Local Files*\n5. Scroll back up to \"**3 - Sync Addons**\" and click on \"**Sync to Stremio**\".\n\n* ***NOTE FOR LATER:***\n   * *Keep in mind for later that if you change catalog structure in AIOMetadata after you installed it on Stremio, or if you add the CouchMoney lists from Step 6 below, then come back to Cinebye, authenticate again with Stremio credentials, and click the **Refresh** icon to the right of AIOMetadata in the \"**Manage Addons**\" section.*\n\n---\n\n# \ud83e\udd16 6. Personalized &amp; Automated Lists\n\nAt this point you are done, YAY!, so you can start enjoying it already OR you can do one more step if you want proper custom lists that are specifically made for you (like Netflix suggestions). There are two approaches for this:\n\n1. **Watchly** is a full-blown recommendations addon that provides real Netflix-like suggestions, and multiple dynamic catalogs depending on what you watch and like. I would recommend this more if you want extensive suggestions, but these catalogs are only on Stremio, they are not Trakt lists, so in case you need the lists for some purpose outside Stremio, you can't.\n2. **CouchMoney** creates personalized Trakt lists, which is a good basic setup, but since Trakt allows only 2 lists for free users, it might be limiting for some.\n\nSo you can decide which you want to use (or both!) and here are the steps for each:\n\n* **Watchly**:\n   1. Go to [**this**](https://watchly.elfhosted.com/) **Watchly** instance.\n   2. Click on \"**Get Started**\".\n   3. Login with your Stremio account email and password (recommended), OR click on \"**Login with Stremio**\", sign in to your Stremio account, and click \"**Accept**\" to allow Watchly to connect to your account (the second approach may expire in the future and you may need to log in again).\n   4. You will then land on the Watchly \"**Preferences**\" page. Configure according to your personal preferences here.\n   5. In the \"**Poster Rating Provider**\" section, select RPDB, and enter \"*t0-free-rpdb*\" in the API key field.\n   6. Click on \"**Next: Catalogs**\" and configure catalogs here also according to your personal preferences.\n   7. Click on \"**Next: Install**\" and click on \"**Save &amp; Install**\".\n   8. Click \"**Install on Web**\" and install the add-on on Stremio.\n   * ***Notes:***\n      * *If you want these Watchly catalogs to show on top (which you'll probably want), go to Cinebye again and change the order of the addons by putting Watchly second, after Cinemeta and before AIOMetadata.*\n      * *If your Stremio account is new, it will not have a watch history yet, so you may get \"Failed to fetch\" or similar issues on the Watchly catalogs when showing on Stremio. Don't worry, they should show up properly once it has enough information to personalize your lists.*\n\n* **CouchMoney**:\n   1. Go to [**CouchMoney**](https://couchmoney.tv/) and click \"**Login with Trakt**\".\n   2. Follow the steps to connect your Trakt account.\n   3. CouchMoney will create two lists for you based on your Trakt watch history and ratings, which you can customize further if you want on this page.\n   4. Go to your AIOMetadata account and sign in if needed (top right there's a sign in button) with your AIOMetadata credentials.\n   5. Go to the \"**Catalogs**\" tab and click on the Trakt icon.\n   6. You should already be connected to your Trakt account here, so scroll down to the \"**Import Lists from Trakt User**\" section.\n   7. Search for your Trakt username (which you can set/check in your Trakt account settings).\n   8. The lists created by CouchMoney should show up here.\n   9. Add them to your Catalog and order them as you wish.\n   * ***Note:** As mentioned above, when you change catalog structure in AIOMetadata, go back to Cinebye, authenticate again with Stremio credentials, and click the **Refresh** icon to the right of AIOMetadata in the \"**Manage Addons**\" section.*\n\nAnd now you're really done! Check out the [**\u2753 Configuration Q&amp;A**](https://luckynumb3rs.github.io/stremio-perfect-setup/guide/8-Configuration-QA) and [**\ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Additional Stuff**](https://luckynumb3rs.github.io/stremio-perfect-setup/guide/7-Additional-Stuff.md) if you want to tweak it further.\n\n---\n\n# \ud83d\ude4f Thanks\n\n**Since a few of you have asked about tipping me for helping**: I prepared the guide because I did it so many times and I realized there are a lot of people that are not doing it just because they need to learn a lot of things in order to get a good working setup. I'm really happy that my guide has been so useful, I really wasn't expecting it to gain so much traction. So I created [**this**](https://ko-fi.com/luckynumb3rs) link where you can tip if you feel like doing so, but I'm very happy you can enjoy Stremio either way!\n\nI hope you like my configuration, but of course you can modify it any way you want. I had to set it up for a few friends lately, so I got my process streamlined now and I though I would share it to maybe help anyone struggling with the many options for configuring the best stream platform in the world: **STREMIO**.\n\n**A special thanks** to the Stremio developers, and all the add-on developers that allow us to enjoy these, it's amazing how this solution exists among all the fragmentation among subscription services which has become very annoying even if you have all the money in the world.\n\n---\n\n# \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Additional Stuff\n\nIf you want to understand how the streams are sorted in the configuration donwloaded here, or want to understand what all the icons on the stream information view mean, or want more colorful icons in there, go to [**\ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Additional Stuff**](https://luckynumb3rs.github.io/stremio-perfect-setup/guide/7-Additional-Stuff) on the extended guide.\n\n---\n\n# \u2753 Configuration Q&amp;A\n\nIf you followed this guide and are encountering issues or have configuration questions, go to [**\u2753 Configuration Q&amp;A**](https://luckynumb3rs.github.io/stremio-perfect-setup/guide/8-Configuration-QA) on the extended guide. If you're just starting, remember this for later in case you need it. **PLEASE avoid asking questions that are already answered there**.\n\n---\n\n# \ud83c\udf9b\ufe0f AIOManager [Power Users]\n\n**AIOManager** is fully optional and intended for power users who want to push their setup further by creating redundant, resilient configurations. If you are looking to increase reliability, add fallback layers, or manage multiple Stremio accounts in a structured way, this chapter is for you. Go to [**\ud83c\udf9b\ufe0f AIOManager [Power Users]**](https://luckynumb3rs.github.io/stremio-perfect-setup/guide/AIOManager-Setup) on the extended guide to learn more and how to set it up.\n\n---\n\n# \ud83d\udd14 Updates\n\nTo do a regular update when a new version of the template for **AIOStreams** is announced/released on this guide (*you can check the version number on the title of the guide*), unless described otherwise in specific updates listed further down, you can simply load the template again by following the same steps on the AIOStreams setup, but here's a short summary again:\n1. Sign in to your **AIOStreams** instance with your **UUID** and **Password**.\n   * *Just to make sure in case you have an old template, go to **Filters** tab, then both in **Stream Expression** and **Regex** respectively, delete all entries configured there (with the red \"trash can\" button to the right).*\n2. Go to the **Save &amp; Install** tab, click \"**Import**\", \"**Import Template**\", paste the [**template link**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/luckynumb3rs/stremio-perfect-setup/refs/heads/main/templates/AIOStreams.json) and click on \"**Go**\".\n3. Click \"**Use this Template Now**\".\n5. On the \"**Select Services**\" page that is shown, enable the Debrid services you are already using (or click \"*Skip*\" if you don't use any), and click \"**Next**\".\n6. On the \"**Enter Credentials**\" page, since you're loading the template over your existing configuration, all API keys needed should already be filled. Otherwise, enter any missing ones.\n7. Click on \"**Load Template**\" and the template is loaded.\n8. **IMPORTANT**: If you made any changes to the configuration after you loaded it when you did the setup for the first time, you may need to do them again (e.g. language changes such as subtitles and language preferences, any addon modifications, etc.).\n9. Click on \"**Save**\" on the \"**Save &amp; Install**\". No need to install the addon on Stremio again.\n\nAs for **AIOMetadata**, there's normally not as many changes as AIOStreams so you shouldn't need to perform any updates unless explicitly required, so here are the steps if needed:\n1. Sign in to your **AIOMetadata** instance with your **UUID** and **Password**.\n2. Go to the \"**Configuration**\" tab, click \"**Import Configuration**\", and load the downloaded [**configuration file**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/luckynumb3rs/stremio-perfect-setup/refs/heads/main/templates/AIOMetadata.json).\n3. **IMPORTANT**: If you made any changes to the configuration after you loaded it when you did the setup for the first time, you may need to do them again (e.g. enabled/disabled/added/removed catalogs, changed any anime settings, etc.).\n4. On the same \"**Configuration**\" tab, click \"**Save Configuration**\".\n\n&gt;**SPECIFIC UPDATES** \n&gt;1. Since the new version of AIOStreams was just released, with a few new features, I have updated and of course improved my ready-to-use AIOStreams template used in this guide. If you already set up AIOStreams through this guide before this announcement, I would definitely recommend to update to the new template. Instructions are at the end of this post. \n&gt;2. Also, **VERY IMPORTANT**, for those of you that configured **AIOStreams** and/or **AIOMetadata** on the *ForTheWeak* instances (compare your links with these: [*aiostreamsfortheweak.nhyira.dev*](https://aiostreamsfortheweak.nhyira.dev/) and [*aiometadatafortheweak.nhyira.dev*](https://aiometadatafortheweak.nhyira.dev/)), coincidentally it was also announced [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/StremioAddons/comments/1r0jgzm/fortheweak_domain_migration/) that those instances are being migrated to a new domain, so you're going to have to migrate your AIOStreams &amp; AIOMetadata configurations on the new instances since the ones you used will be closed after a transitory phase. Not to worry though, it's easy.

Accounts Preparation&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First, let&amp;#39;s start by creating the accounts (those who already have them can skip these steps):&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Obviously, start by creating a new free &lt;a href=\"https://www.stremio.com\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stremio&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; account.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Choose a Debrid service for caching the torrents, create an account on it, buy a subscription, and get the API key.\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is optional, but HIGHLY recommended.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;For those who don&amp;#39;t know, this is the only thing you will be paying for (about 32\u20ac for Real-Debrid or $33 for TorBox for 12 months). It&amp;#39;s used as an intermediary to serve the files to you from their servers, instead of relying on torrent which may be slow and inefficient. This means faster loading, almost no buffering, and more high-quality stream options. I would definitely recommend getting this.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;I use mainly&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://torbox.app/subscription?referral=4f317900-e517-47f3-a62b-f094ec06e851\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;TorBox&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, as a backup I use &lt;a href=\"http://real-debrid.com/?id=8801126\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Real-Debrid&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;(these are referral links since we&amp;#39;re at it :), two of the best platforms, with the best prices and very stable.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;For *&lt;/em&gt;TorBox&lt;strong&gt;, please make sure to use my referral code when ordering: **4f317900-e517-47f3-a62b-f094ec06e851&lt;/strong&gt; to get 7 additional days for each month you buy (only for the first purchase, so I recommend you go big from the start and buy the yearly, it&amp;#39;s a better value and you get 84 additional days for free). You can also buy the cheapest tier for a year initially to get the extra 3 months, and if you need a higher tier, you can upgrade along the way, it is possible. &lt;strong&gt;IMPORTANT&lt;/strong&gt;: When you&amp;#39;re on the subscription plans page, scroll down to the bottom and you&amp;#39;ll see a field (not the &amp;quot;Coupon Code&amp;quot; field just below the plans, but to the very bottom of the page) where you can enter my code (not to be confused with the &amp;quot;Your referral code is:&amp;quot; part above it) and click &lt;strong&gt;Submit&lt;/strong&gt;. Then you can proceed with buying your chosen plan.*&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;To help you choose between Real-Debrid and TorBox:&lt;/em&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;**Real-Debrid&lt;/em&gt;* is one of the most widely used service, and has probably the largest cache (files already available on their servers and ready to watch) of shows and movies. However, they only allow one connection at a time, meaning that you can&amp;#39;t watch on two or more devices simultaneously (you can log in to your Stremio account on as many devices you want, that&amp;#39;s unrelated). So if you want to use it with friends or family or on multiple Stremio accounts to watch simultaneously, you can&amp;#39;t: you&amp;#39;ll get a warning and may risk getting banned if repeated.*&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;**TorBox&lt;/em&gt;* allows in it&amp;#39;s most basic paid option up to 3 parallel connections, and has tiers with up to 10 parallel streams, which means that you can use the same API key for e.g. your entire family or friends, or multiple Stremio accounts. However, it may not have the large cache of readily available shows like Real-Debrid has, so it might happen that you cannot watch a show immediately because it needs to download it first (you see that in the source links marked with an hourglass icon. This may take time depending on the seeders available, but it&amp;#39;s also usually fast). It usually has more than enough options cached for each show though, and you only need one :).*&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;The choice is yours. TorBox would be very practical and cheaper for multiple screens or families, but Real-Debrid would MAYBE provide more immediately available options. I myself use *&lt;/em&gt;both** (you can enable both in AIOStreams, and considering the prices for both, it&amp;#39;s still cheap): I use TorBox as my main, because my family can safely use it simultaneously, and I also keep a backup Real-Debrid, in case it may happen that Real-Debrid has a result that TorBox doesn&amp;#39;t immediately have (always keeping in mind though that Real-Debrid only allows 1 connection, hence as a backup only).*&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;ONLY AFTER you registered to one or both services from the links above and subscribed to a plan (and paid for it), you can get the *&lt;/em&gt;API key** while logged in to your account directly on &lt;a href=\"https://real-debrid.com/apitoken\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;this&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; link for Real-Debrid or &lt;a href=\"https://torbox.app/settings?section=account\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;here&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for TorBox.*&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Create a free &lt;a href=\"http://www.trakt.tv\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trakt&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; account.\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is recommended for tracking what you watch, and getting some custom lists. Makes the Stremio experience more like Netflix. If your account is new, rate or mark as watched at least 10 movies and 10 shows, it will be good for creating custom lists later below, otherwise they won&amp;#39;t work.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Create a &lt;a href=\"https://www.themoviedb.org/\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TMDB&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; account and get a free API key:\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;TMDB is used for the metadata (descriptions, cast, etc.) of Movies.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Click on your profile icon on the top right and click on &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;Settings&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot;.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Click &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;API&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot;.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;In the &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;Request an API Key&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot; click on &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;To generate a new API key, click here&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Click &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;Yes&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot; when asked &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Is the intended use of our API for personal use?&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Fill the form with whatever info (doesn&amp;#39;t have to be correct), and click &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;Subscribe&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot;.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;When successful, you will get taken to a page that reads &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;You are currently on the Free Developer plan.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;, and click on &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;Access your API key details here&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot;.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Copy the &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;API Read Access Token&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot; and the &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;API Key&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot;.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Create a &lt;a href=\"https://www.thetvdb.com/\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TVDB&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; account and get a free API key:\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;TVDB is used for the metadata (descriptions, cast, etc.) of Series.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;After being logged in to the account, go to &lt;a href=\"https://www.thetvdb.com/api-information\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;this&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; page.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Select any options from the checklist that shows and click &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;Save&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot;.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Click &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;Get Started&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot;.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Make sure &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;Less than $50k per year&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot; is selected in &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Company / Project Revenue&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;, fill the rest with whatever info (doesn&amp;#39;t have to be correct), and click &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;Submit&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot;.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Copy the API key that is shown on the &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;API Signup Success&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot; page.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Create a &lt;strong&gt;Google/Gmail&lt;/strong&gt; account if you don&amp;#39;t have one, and get a free &lt;strong&gt;Gemini&lt;/strong&gt; API key:\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Optional, but recommended for AI searches, to search not only for movie or show names, but also e.g. &amp;quot;movies like Batman&amp;quot; or more complex searches.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;When logged in to your Google account, go to &lt;a href=\"https://aistudio.google.com/api-keys\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Google AI Studio&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Accept the agreement if it&amp;#39;s your first time opening it, by enabling the checkbox and clicking &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;Continue&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot;.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;An API key should normally get created automatically on the list, called &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;Default Gemini API Key&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot;.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Click on the clickable link on the &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;Key&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot; column, and copy the &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;API Key&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot;.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;If no key is created automatically, just create one by clicking &amp;quot;Create API Key&amp;quot; on the top right.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;(&lt;strong&gt;Optional&lt;/strong&gt;) Totally optional and not a must at all, but if Trakt feels limiting with its rate limits or you want more curated lists, check out these friendly alternatives that work great with AIOMetadata:\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MDBList&lt;/strong&gt;: Perfect for discovering user-curated catalogs and tracking your watched content seamlessly.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Simkl&lt;/strong&gt;: A Trakt-like experience with check-ins and watch history, plus extra flexibility.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You can use them alongside Trakt or as a replacement for a smoother, more personalized setup.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Head to &lt;a href=\"https://luckynumb3rs.github.io/stremio-perfect-setup/guide/7-Additional-Stuff/#enriching-your-catalogs-trakt-alternatives\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;\ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Additional Stuff&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on the extended guide for easy setup steps.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;\u2699\ufe0f 2. Stremio Account Initialization&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Second, let&amp;#39;s prepare the Stremio account properly:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Open &lt;a href=\"https://web.stremio.com\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stremio Web&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;MAKE SURE&lt;/strong&gt; you&amp;#39;re signed in with your account.\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IMPORTANT&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;Do not confuse&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.stremio.com\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;www.stremio.com&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, which is for account management, with&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://web.stremio.com\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;web.stremio.com&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, which you *&lt;/em&gt;MUST** be signed in to for removing/installing the addons. Being signed in to* &lt;a href=\"https://www.stremio.com\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;www.stremio.com&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;does not automatically sign you in to&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://web.stremio.com\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;web.stremio.com&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, and your addons will not install on your account.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Obviously you need a browser to configure everything on this guide, including using the *&lt;/em&gt;Web** version of Stremio to remove and install addons. Don&amp;#39;t worry though, after you set everything up &lt;strong&gt;ONCE&lt;/strong&gt;, you can use your setup everywhere you use Stremio (Smart TV, Android, iOS, Windows, everywhere).*&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Go to &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;Settings&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot; in &lt;a href=\"https://www.stremio.com\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stremio Account&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and enable &lt;strong&gt;Trakt Scrobbling&lt;/strong&gt; by connecting it to your Trakt account.\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;This will allow Stremio to sync show progress and history with Trakt.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Go to &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;Addons&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot; and uninstall all addons.\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Also remove the *&lt;/em&gt;Trakt Integration** addon, it is separate from &lt;strong&gt;Trakt Scrobbling&lt;/strong&gt; (which you need), and you don&amp;#39;t need it because we will use something else for this.*&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cinemeta and Local Files cannot be removed. Leave them, we will take care of this later.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;\ud83d\udcda 3. AIOStreams [Find Streams]&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AIOStreams&lt;/strong&gt; is the stream aggregation engine in this setup. It combines multiple scraping sources into one consistent results list, and lets you apply filtering, sorting, and formatting so the best links appear first.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Select an &lt;strong&gt;AIOStreams&lt;/strong&gt; instance from &lt;a href=\"https://status.stremio-status.com/\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;this&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"https://status.dinsden.top/status/stremio-addons\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;this&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; link (they both show the same instances and their online status, it&amp;#39;s just two different sources) and:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;**WARNING&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;:&lt;/em&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you want to understand more what an instance means, go to &lt;a href=\"https://luckynumb3rs.github.io/stremio-perfect-setup/guide/0-Beginner-Concepts/#what-does-an-addon-instance-mean\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;\ud83d\udd30 Beginner Concepts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on the extended guide.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;[&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Midnight&amp;#39;s&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;](&lt;a href=\"https://aiostreamsfortheweebsstable.midnightignite.me/\"&gt;https://aiostreamsfortheweebsstable.midnightignite.me/&lt;/a&gt;) or &lt;a href=\"https://aiostreams.fortheweak.cloud/\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yeb&amp;#39;s&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are some of the most popular, so you can use these links directly, but almost all are viable options.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you go with *&lt;/em&gt;Yeb&amp;#39;s&lt;strong&gt;, **DON&amp;#39;T&lt;/strong&gt; use the old &lt;a href=\"https://aiostreamsfortheweak.nhyira.dev/\"&gt;aiostreamsfortheweak.nhyira.dev&lt;/a&gt; link, but &lt;a href=\"https://aiostreams.fortheweak.cloud/\"&gt;aiostreams.fortheweak.cloud&lt;/a&gt;, as linked right above.*&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;**DON&amp;#39;T&lt;/em&gt;* choose an instance that says &lt;strong&gt;Nightly&lt;/strong&gt;, since they may not be stable.*&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;**DON&amp;#39;T&lt;/em&gt;* choose the &lt;strong&gt;ElfHosted&lt;/strong&gt; instance because Torrentio doesn&amp;#39;t work there.*&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Choose one of the instances and stick with it, you will store your configuration here, and if you change to the other instance, you&amp;#39;ll need to do it again because it&amp;#39;s not automatically transferred&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can keep the monitoring links above for later to check the instance online status, if it happens that it&amp;#39;s not working and might be temporarily down.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Select &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;Advanced&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot; on the welcome screen if it shows up.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Copy &lt;a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/luckynumb3rs/stremio-perfect-setup/refs/heads/main/templates/AIOStreams.json\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;this&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; link (right-click and &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Copy link address&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Go to the &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;Save &amp;amp; Install&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot; tab on AIOStreams (sidebar menu on the left), click &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;Import&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;Import Template&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot;, paste the link you copied and click on &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;Go&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot;.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Click &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;Use this Template Now&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot;.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;On the &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;Select Services&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot; page that is shown, enable the Debrid services you want to use (or click &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Skip&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot; if you don&amp;#39;t use any), and click &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;Next&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot;.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;On the &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;Enter Credentials&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot; page, enter all API keys you prepared earlier.\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;For &lt;strong&gt;RPDB&lt;/strong&gt;, unless you have an account and a paid subscription with your own API key, you can also use the free standard API Key &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;t0-free-rpdb&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot; directly.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Click on &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;Load Template&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot;.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Optional&lt;/strong&gt;: At this point AIOStreams is ready, but you can keep configuring it however you like. For example, if you want to further configure the scrapers or subtitle languages, you can go to the &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;Installed Addons&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot; tab, where you will see:\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can configure each of them with the Pencil button on the right if needed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Torrentio, StremThru, Comet, MediaFusion, Jackettio&lt;/strong&gt; are the scrapers finding the sources.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SeaDex and AnimeTosho&lt;/strong&gt; are for Anime and initially disabled. &lt;strong&gt;If you want Anime results&lt;/strong&gt; you need to enable these.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nuvio Streams&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;WebStreamr&lt;/strong&gt; are HTTP scrapers that provide direct web streams, initially disabled. you can use these if you don&amp;#39;t/can&amp;#39;t use debrid and/or torrents. They may be more limited in quality and availability, but are a good alternative.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SubHero&lt;/strong&gt; is for the subtitles, you can edit the languages and any other subtitle preferences here.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;**SeaDex&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;, *&lt;/em&gt;AnimeTosho&lt;strong&gt;, and **Jackettio&lt;/strong&gt; need a debrid service, so if not using one, you need to disable them.*&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you want to have a language other than English to show first on the results list, go to *&lt;/em&gt;Filters** tab, then &lt;strong&gt;Language&lt;/strong&gt;, and add your language to the &lt;strong&gt;Preferred Languages&lt;/strong&gt; list, and put it first in the &lt;strong&gt;Preference Order&lt;/strong&gt; list. You can also add the language in the &lt;strong&gt;Required Languages&lt;/strong&gt; to ONLY show streams in that language, but keep in mind that streams that might have no language tags at all or tagged as &amp;quot;multi&amp;quot; will not be shown.*&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you want to take it a step further and totally prioritize your language, even before Quality and Resolution, then go to the *&lt;/em&gt;Sorting** tab, select &lt;strong&gt;Cached&lt;/strong&gt; on the &lt;strong&gt;Sort Order Type&lt;/strong&gt; dropdown menu, and on the &lt;strong&gt;Order&lt;/strong&gt; section, move &lt;strong&gt;Language&lt;/strong&gt; to the top or wherever you want to have it. Do this also for the &lt;strong&gt;Uncached&lt;/strong&gt; sort order type.*&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Go to the &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;Save &amp;amp; Install&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot; tab, enter a password on the &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;Create Configuration&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot; section, and click &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;Create&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot;.\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ALWAYS SAVE IN THIS TAB EVERY TIME YOU MAKE CHANGES LATER.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Copy and store the *&lt;/em&gt;UUID** that is shown and the &lt;strong&gt;Password&lt;/strong&gt; you set for later to access the configuration again. This is basically your AIOStreams account.*&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you can&amp;#39;t save the configuration with the error &amp;quot;Jackettio requires a debrid service&amp;quot;, which happens in case you are not using any debrids, then just uninstall Jackettio from the &amp;quot;Installed Addons&amp;quot; tab.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you can&amp;#39;t save the configuration with errors like &amp;quot;Jackettio/SeaDex/AnimeTosho requires a debrid service...&amp;quot;, which happens in case you are not using any debrids, then just disable Jackettio, SeaDex, and AnimeTosho from the &amp;quot;Installed Addons&amp;quot; tab. If you watch Anime, the other scrapers might still find results, but SeaDex and AnimeTosho increase the chances. You do need a debrid service to use them though.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Click &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;Install&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot; and install the add-on on Stremio.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;NOTE FOR LATER:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you see that you are getting results too slowly, try changing the fetching strategy. Go to *&lt;/em&gt;Addons&lt;strong&gt;, scroll down to **Addon Fetching Strategy&lt;/strong&gt;. and select &lt;strong&gt;Dynamic&lt;/strong&gt;. There should already be an exit condition pre-filled, which you can leave as is, and save the configuration. However, keep in mind that this might leave out relevant results, so try it yourself. On the other hand, if you feel you&amp;#39;re not getting enough good results, do the opposite and select &lt;strong&gt;Default&lt;/strong&gt; instead.*&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you prefer results for a language other than English, and you are not happy with the results you&amp;#39;re getting, try disabling matching. Go to *&lt;/em&gt;Filters&lt;strong&gt;, then **Matching&lt;/strong&gt;, and switch off the &lt;strong&gt;Enable&lt;/strong&gt; toggle in all three sections (Title Matching, Year Matching, Season/Episode Matching).*&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;\ud83d\udd0e 4. AIOMetadata [Metadata &amp;amp; Catalogs]&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AIOMetadata&lt;/strong&gt; is the metadata and catalogs layer. It improves discovery by powering richer catalogs, search behavior, and integrations, so browsing titles in Stremio feels more complete and organized.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Select an &lt;strong&gt;AIOMetdata&lt;/strong&gt; instance from &lt;a href=\"https://status.stremio-status.com/\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;this&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"https://status.dinsden.top/status/stremio-addons\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;this&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; link (they both show the same instances and their online status, it&amp;#39;s just two different sources) and:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;**WARNING&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;:&lt;/em&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you want to understand more what an instance means, go to &lt;a href=\"https://luckynumb3rs.github.io/stremio-perfect-setup/guide/0-Beginner-Concepts/#what-does-an-addon-instance-mean\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;\ud83d\udd30 Beginner Concepts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on the extended guide.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;[&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Viren&amp;#39;s&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;](&lt;a href=\"https://aiometadata.viren070.me/\"&gt;https://aiometadata.viren070.me/&lt;/a&gt;) or &lt;a href=\"https://aiometadatafortheweebs.midnightignite.me/\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Midnight&amp;#39;s&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are some of the most popular, so you can use these links directly, but almost all are viable options.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;**Yeb&amp;#39;s&lt;/em&gt;* and &lt;strong&gt;Kuu&amp;#39;s&lt;/strong&gt; are not working with Trakt currently because Trakt has imposed strict rate limits lately, so &lt;strong&gt;DON&amp;#39;T&lt;/strong&gt; use these instances for now.*&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Choose one of the instances and stick with it, you will store your configuration here, and if you change to the other instance, you&amp;#39;ll need to configure it again because it&amp;#39;s not automatically transferred.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can keep the monitoring links above for later to check the instance online status, if it happens that it&amp;#39;s not working and might be temporarily down.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Download my configuration file &lt;a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/luckynumb3rs/stremio-perfect-setup/refs/heads/main/templates/AIOMetadata.json\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;here&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (right-click, &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Save As&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;, and save it as &lt;code&gt;.json&lt;/code&gt;, not &lt;code&gt;.txt&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Go to the &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;Configuration&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot; tab, click on &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;Import Configuration&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot;, and load my configuration file.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Go to the &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;Integrations&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot; tab, and enter the API keys for Gemini, TMDB, TheTVDB, RPDB.\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;For *&lt;/em&gt;RPDB*&lt;em&gt;, unless you have an account and a paid subscription with your own API key, you can also use the free standard API Key &amp;quot;t0-free-rpdb&amp;quot; directly.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Go to the &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;Catalogs&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot; tab, and near the &amp;quot;Quick Add&amp;quot; button, you will see the &lt;strong&gt;Trakt&lt;/strong&gt; icon. Click on it and follow the steps to connect your Trakt account.\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;NOTES&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: \n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you encounter any issues with Trakt integration on AIOMetadata, it&amp;#39;s probably because Trakt is rate limiting the instance you&amp;#39;re using, or the instance provider has disabled it (if it says &amp;quot;Instance owner has not yet set up the Trakt integration.&amp;quot;). In that case, try to do the AIOMetadata setup with another instance.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alternatively, you can leave Trakt integration disabled, and hide the Trakt catalogs on the list (marked with a red *&lt;/em&gt;Trakt** tag on the right) by clicking the green eye icon for each. I know it&amp;#39;s not ideal since you created a Trakt account already, but there&amp;#39;s nothing we can do about it. You can still add other catalogs from the other sources there.*&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;There are also good alternatives to Trakt if you disable it, both for watch history tracking, and curated catalogs, which you can check out in &lt;a href=\"https://luckynumb3rs.github.io/stremio-perfect-setup/guide/7-Additional-Stuff/#enriching-your-catalogs-trakt-alternatives\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;\ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Additional Stuff&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on the extended guide.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you want some ready-to-use and well-maintained lists, while on the Trakt tab, search for the lists from user &amp;quot;snoak&amp;quot;, and you will be able to import a lot of interesting lists. I have already included some of them in the catalog, but you can add more.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For Anime users&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;If you want to enable search for Anime, make sure to go to to the &amp;quot;Search&amp;quot; tab and enable both &amp;quot;Anime Search Engine&amp;quot; switches.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For other languages&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;If you want the metadata (descriptions, titles, etc.) to show in a different language than English, go to the &amp;quot;General&amp;quot; tab and change the &amp;quot;Display Language&amp;quot;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Optional&lt;/strong&gt;: At this point AIOMetadata is ready, but you can keep configuring it however you like, but otherwise the configuration I provided is ready to be used. On the &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;Catalogs&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot; tab you can add, remove, enable, disable catalogs depending on your preferences.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Go to the &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;Configuration&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot; tab again and click on &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;Save Configuration&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot;.\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ALWAYS SAVE IN THIS TAB EVERY TIME YOU MAKE CHANGES LATER.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Copy and store the *&lt;/em&gt;UUID** that is shown and the &lt;strong&gt;Password&lt;/strong&gt; you set for later to access the configuration again. This is basically your AIOMetadata account.*&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Click &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;Install&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot; and install the add-on on Stremio.\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you get a &amp;quot;AddonsPushedToAPI Max descriptor size reached&amp;quot; error when installing, you probably have too many catalogs on AIOMetadata. Disable some, save the configuration, and try to install it again.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you didn&amp;#39;t want to get an API key for Gemini, go to the *&lt;/em&gt;Search** tab and disable &lt;strong&gt;AI-Powered Search&lt;/strong&gt; to be able to save.*&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;NOTE FOR LATER:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Keep in mind that if you want to change catalogs after you have installed AIOMetadata on Stremio, you need to refresh the installation, otherwise the catalogs with not show. You do that with Cinebye below.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;\ud83e\uddf9 5.

Personalized &amp;amp; Automated Lists&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At this point you are done, YAY!, so you can start enjoying it already OR you can do one more step if you want proper custom lists that are specifically made for you (like Netflix suggestions). There are two approaches for this:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watchly&lt;/strong&gt; is a full-blown recommendations addon that provides real Netflix-like suggestions, and multiple dynamic catalogs depending on what you watch and like. I would recommend this more if you want extensive suggestions, but these catalogs are only on Stremio, they are not Trakt lists, so in case you need the lists for some purpose outside Stremio, you can&amp;#39;t.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CouchMoney&lt;/strong&gt; creates personalized Trakt lists, which is a good basic setup, but since Trakt allows only 2 lists for free users, it might be limiting for some.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So you can decide which you want to use (or both!) and here are the steps for each:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watchly&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Go to &lt;a href=\"https://watchly.elfhosted.com/\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;this&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Watchly&lt;/strong&gt; instance.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Click on &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;Get Started&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot;.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Login with your Stremio account email and password (recommended), OR click on &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;Login with Stremio&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot;, sign in to your Stremio account, and click &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;Accept&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot; to allow Watchly to connect to your account (the second approach may expire in the future and you may need to log in again).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You will then land on the Watchly &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;Preferences&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot; page. Configure according to your personal preferences here.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;In the &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;Poster Rating Provider&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot; section, select RPDB, and enter &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;t0-free-rpdb&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot; in the API key field.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Click on &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;Next: Catalogs&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot; and configure catalogs here also according to your personal preferences.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Click on &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;Next: Install&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot; and click on &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;Save &amp;amp; Install&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot;.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Click &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;Install on Web&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot; and install the add-on on Stremio.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Notes:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you want these Watchly catalogs to show on top (which you&amp;#39;ll probably want), go to Cinebye again and change the order of the addons by putting Watchly second, after Cinemeta and before AIOMetadata.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;If your Stremio account is new, it will not have a watch history yet, so you may get &amp;quot;Failed to fetch&amp;quot; or similar issues on the Watchly catalogs when showing on Stremio. Don&amp;#39;t worry, they should show up properly once it has enough information to personalize your lists.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CouchMoney&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Go to &lt;a href=\"https://couchmoney.tv/\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CouchMoney&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and click &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;Login with Trakt&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot;.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Follow the steps to connect your Trakt account.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;CouchMoney will create two lists for you based on your Trakt watch history and ratings, which you can customize further if you want on this page.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Go to your AIOMetadata account and sign in if needed (top right there&amp;#39;s a sign in button) with your AIOMetadata credentials.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Go to the &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;Catalogs&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot; tab and click on the Trakt icon.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You should already be connected to your Trakt account here, so scroll down to the &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;Import Lists from Trakt User&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot; section.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Search for your Trakt username (which you can set/check in your Trakt account settings).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The lists created by CouchMoney should show up here.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Add them to your Catalog and order them as you wish.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;**Note:&lt;/em&gt;* As mentioned above, when you change catalog structure in AIOMetadata, go back to Cinebye, authenticate again with Stremio credentials, and click the &lt;strong&gt;Refresh&lt;/strong&gt; icon to the right of AIOMetadata in the &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;Manage Addons&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot; section.*&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And now you&amp;#39;re really done! Check out the &lt;a href=\"https://luckynumb3rs.github.io/stremio-perfect-setup/guide/8-Configuration-QA\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;\u2753 Configuration Q&amp;amp;A&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"https://luckynumb3rs.github.io/stremio-perfect-setup/guide/7-Additional-Stuff.md\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;\ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Additional Stuff&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; if you want to tweak it further.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;\ud83d\ude4f Thanks&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Since a few of you have asked about tipping me for helping&lt;/strong&gt;: I prepared the guide because I did it so many times and I realized there are a lot of people that are not doing it just because they need to learn a lot of things in order to get a good working setup. I&amp;#39;m really happy that my guide has been so useful, I really wasn&amp;#39;t expecting it to gain so much traction. So I created &lt;a href=\"https://ko-fi.com/luckynumb3rs\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;this&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; link where you can tip if you feel like doing so, but I&amp;#39;m very happy you can enjoy Stremio either way!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hope you like my configuration, but of course you can modify it any way you want. I had to set it up for a few friends lately, so I got my process streamlined now and I though I would share it to maybe help anyone struggling with the many options for configuring the best stream platform in the world: &lt;strong&gt;STREMIO&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A special thanks&lt;/strong&gt; to the Stremio developers, and all the add-on developers that allow us to enjoy these, it&amp;#39;s amazing how this solution exists among all the fragmentation among subscription services which has become very annoying even if you have all the money in the world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;\ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Additional Stuff&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you want to understand how the streams are sorted in the configuration donwloaded here, or want to understand what all the icons on the stream information view mean, or want more colorful icons in there, go to &lt;a href=\"https://luckynumb3rs.github.io/stremio-perfect-setup/guide/7-Additional-Stuff\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;\ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Additional Stuff&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on the extended guide.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;\u2753 Configuration Q&amp;amp;A&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you followed this guide and are encountering issues or have configuration questions, go to &lt;a href=\"https://luckynumb3rs.github.io/stremio-perfect-setup/guide/8-Configuration-QA\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;\u2753 Configuration Q&amp;amp;A&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on the extended guide. If you&amp;#39;re just starting, remember this for later in case you need it. &lt;strong&gt;PLEASE avoid asking questions that are already answered there&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;\ud83c\udf9b\ufe0f AIOManager [Power Users]&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AIOManager&lt;/strong&gt; is fully optional and intended for power users who want to push their setup further by creating redundant, resilient configurations. If you are looking to increase reliability, add fallback layers, or manage multiple Stremio accounts in a structured way, this chapter is for you. Go to &lt;a href=\"https://luckynumb3rs.github.io/stremio-perfect-setup/guide/AIOManager-Setup\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;\ud83c\udf9b\ufe0f AIOManager [Power Users]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on the extended guide to learn more and how to set it up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;\ud83d\udd14 Updates&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To do a regular update when a new version of the template for &lt;strong&gt;AIOStreams&lt;/strong&gt; is announced/released on this guide (&lt;em&gt;you can check the version number on the title of the guide&lt;/em&gt;), unless described otherwise in specific updates listed further down, you can simply load the template again by following the same steps on the AIOStreams setup, but here&amp;#39;s a short summary again:\n1. Sign in to your &lt;strong&gt;AIOStreams&lt;/strong&gt; instance with your &lt;strong&gt;UUID&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Password&lt;/strong&gt;.\n   * &lt;em&gt;Just to make sure in case you have an old template, go to *&lt;/em&gt;Filters** tab, then both in &lt;strong&gt;Stream Expression&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Regex&lt;/strong&gt; respectively, delete all entries configured there (with the red &amp;quot;trash can&amp;quot; button to the right).*\n2. Go to the &lt;strong&gt;Save &amp;amp; Install&lt;/strong&gt; tab, click &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;Import&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;Import Template&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot;, paste the &lt;a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/luckynumb3rs/stremio-perfect-setup/refs/heads/main/templates/AIOStreams.json\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;template link&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and click on &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;Go&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot;.\n3. Click &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;Use this Template Now&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot;.\n5. On the &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;Select Services&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot; page that is shown, enable the Debrid services you are already using (or click &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Skip&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot; if you don&amp;#39;t use any), and click &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;Next&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot;.\n6. On the &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;Enter Credentials&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot; page, since you&amp;#39;re loading the template over your existing configuration, all API keys needed should already be filled. Otherwise, enter any missing ones.\n7. Click on &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;Load Template&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot; and the template is loaded.\n8. &lt;strong&gt;IMPORTANT&lt;/strong&gt;: If you made any changes to the configuration after you loaded it when you did the setup for the first time, you may need to do them again (e.g. language changes such as subtitles and language preferences, any addon modifications, etc.).\n9. Click on &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;Save&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot; on the &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;Save &amp;amp; Install&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot;. No need to install the addon on Stremio again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As for &lt;strong&gt;AIOMetadata&lt;/strong&gt;, there&amp;#39;s normally not as many changes as AIOStreams so you shouldn&amp;#39;t need to perform any updates unless explicitly required, so here are the steps if needed:\n1. Sign in to your &lt;strong&gt;AIOMetadata&lt;/strong&gt; instance with your &lt;strong&gt;UUID&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Password&lt;/strong&gt;.\n2. Go to the &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;Configuration&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot; tab, click &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;Import Configuration&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot;, and load the downloaded &lt;a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/luckynumb3rs/stremio-perfect-setup/refs/heads/main/templates/AIOMetadata.json\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;configuration file&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.\n3. &lt;strong&gt;IMPORTANT&lt;/strong&gt;: If you made any changes to the configuration after you loaded it when you did the setup for the first time, you may need to do them again (e.g. enabled/disabled/added/removed catalogs, changed any anime settings, etc.).\n4. On the same &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;Configuration&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot; tab, click &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;Save Configuration&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SPECIFIC UPDATES&lt;/strong&gt; \n1. Since the new version of AIOStreams was just released, with a few new features, I have updated and of course improved my ready-to-use AIOStreams template used in this guide. If you already set up AIOStreams through this guide before this announcement, I would definitely recommend to update to the new template. Instructions are at the end of this post. \n2. Also, &lt;strong&gt;VERY IMPORTANT&lt;/strong&gt;, for those of you that configured &lt;strong&gt;AIOStreams&lt;/strong&gt; and/or &lt;strong&gt;AIOMetadata&lt;/strong&gt; on the &lt;em&gt;ForTheWeak&lt;/em&gt; instances (compare your links with these: &lt;a href=\"https://aiostreamsfortheweak.nhyira.dev/\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;aiostreamsfortheweak.nhyira.dev&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"https://aiometadatafortheweak.nhyira.dev/\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;aiometadatafortheweak.nhyira.dev&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), coincidentally it was also announced &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/StremioAddons/comments/1r0jgzm/fortheweak_domain_migration/\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; that those instances are being migrated to a new domain, so you&amp;#39;re going to have to migrate your AIOStreams &amp;amp; AIOMetadata configurations on the new instances since the ones you used will be closed after a transitory phase. Not to worry though, it&amp;#39;s easy. Read below.\n* Go to &lt;a href=\"https://luckynumb3rs.github.io/stremio-perfect-setup/guide/Updates\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;\ud83d\udd14 Updates&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on the extended guide for more information.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "9eefaba6-b86c-11ee-b46d-c2d5cb29fff2", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_uxae6", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#73ad34", "id": "1qvn9rk", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "aguytwoguys", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 1130, "send_replies": true, "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/StremioAddons/comments/1qvn9rk/my_stremio_perfect_setup_for_me_at_least_sharing/", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/StremioAddons/comments/1qvn9rk/my_stremio_perfect_setup_for_me_at_least_sharing/", "subreddit_subscribers": 231279, "created_utc": 1770208170.0, "num_crossposts": 10, "media": null, "is_video": false}}], "before": null}}}
