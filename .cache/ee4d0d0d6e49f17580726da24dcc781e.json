As part of this effort, Lodash is rebooting its governance. A draft charter will be published shortly. The upcoming Technical Steering Committee (TSC) is already at work. For transparency, its members are listed in [GOVERNANCE.md](https://github.com/lodash/lodash/blob/HEAD/GOVERNANCE.md).\n\nThe [Lodash](https://lodash.com/) library exported as a [UMD](https://github.com/umdjs/umd) module.\n\nGenerated using [lodash-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lodash-cli):\n```shell\n$ npm run build\n$ lodash -o ./dist/lodash.js\n$ lodash core -o ./dist/lodash.core.js\n```\n\n## Download\n\n * [Core build](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lodash/lodash/4.17.23/dist/lodash.core.js) ([~4 kB gzipped](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lodash/lodash/4.17.23/dist/lodash.core.min.js))\n * [Full build](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lodash/lodash/4.17.23/dist/lodash.js) ([~24 kB gzipped](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lodash/lodash/4.17.23/dist/lodash.min.js))\n * [CDN copies](https://www.jsdelivr.com/projects/lodash)\n\nLodash is released under the [MIT license](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lodash/lodash/4.17.23/LICENSE) & supports modern environments.<br>\nReview the [build differences](https://github.com/lodash/lodash/wiki/build-differences) & pick one that\u2019s right for you.\n\n## Installation\n\nIn a browser:\n```html\n<script src=\"lodash.js\"></script>\n```\n\nUsing npm:\n```shell\n$ npm i -g npm\n$ npm i --save lodash\n```\n\nIn Node.js:\n```js\n// Load the full build.\nvar _ = require('lodash');\n// Load the core build.\nvar _ = require('lodash/core');\n// Load the FP build for immutable auto-curried iteratee-first data-last methods.\nvar fp = require('lodash/fp');\n\n// Load method categories.\nvar array = require('lodash/array');\nvar object = require('lodash/fp/object');\n\n// Cherry-pick methods for smaller browserify/rollup/webpack bundles.\nvar at = require('lodash/at');\nvar curryN = require('lodash/fp/curryN');\n```\n\n**Note:**<br>\nInstall [n_](https://www.npmjs.com/package/n_) for Lodash use in the Node.js < 6 REPL.\n\n## Why Lodash?\n\nLodash makes JavaScript easier by taking the hassle out of working with arrays,<br>\nnumbers, objects, strings, etc. Lodash\u2019s modular methods are great for:\n\n * Iterating arrays, objects, & strings\n * Manipulating & testing values\n * Creating composite functions\n\n## Module Formats\n\nLodash is available in a [variety of builds](https://lodash.com/custom-builds) & module formats.\n\n * [lodash](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lodash) & [per method packages](https://www.npmjs.com/browse/keyword/lodash-modularized)\n * [lodash-es](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lodash-es), [babel-plugin-lodash](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-plugin-lodash), & [lodash-webpack-plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lodash-webpack-plugin)\n * [lodash/fp](https://github.com/lodash/lodash/tree/npm/fp)\n * [lodash-amd](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lodash-amd)\n\n\n"}
