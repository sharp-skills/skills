I was fed up switching between multiple UIs to ask GPT, Claude, etc\u2026 the same question and comparing the answers.

This way you still get a fast response as normal from the 1st model, but also get any added value provided by the 2nd model.<p>Initially I built my own UI to use this, but stumbled upon Open WebUI (formerly Ollama WebUI) which is fantastic, but is made more for local access to LLMs. So I talked to its creator, Timothy Baek, and he mentioned that security needed to be shored up before <em>production</em> deployment. I did some scans with semgrep, and fixed some XSRF and CORS issues along with making sure the <em>JWT</em> tokens, passwords, etc\u2026 were secure. This was in addition to other folks' amazing security contributions. So now we build on Open WebUI! oss ftw<p>After launching privately a month or so ago and posting a few reddit links, I have about 100 users.<p>We also just got access to the o1 API and provide o1-high, medium, and low effort. o1 high effort is able to solve coding problems that only o1 pro can also solve, though pro can go further and has better formatting, o1 high effort is a nice option if you don't want to fork over $200/mo.<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1i0r867/comment/m70xlsk/?context=3\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1i0r867/comment/m70...</a><p>You can use o1 for free in PolyChat, which is the only place I've seen you can do so.<p>You can also ask multiple models the same question and stream the answers simultaneously side by side. <a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/ly5ZPh8\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://imgur.com/a/ly5ZPh8</a><p>And you can have multiple chats going simultaneously and they will continue in the background and notify you when they're done.<p>Another cool feature that makes long chats way easier to navigate is the overview (three dots on top right of chat) <a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/PoB1phT\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://imgur.com/a/PoB1phT</a><p>We give you full control, unlike most providers, to change the system prompt, temperature, etc.. in the chat settings in the &quot;Controls&quot; on the top right.<p>The formatting for code outputs and inputs is fantastic, using codemirror, and you can run code in the code blocks if it's python or JS using in-browser runtimes.<p>You can also share chats within polychat where other logged in users can see them:<p>e.g. <a href=\"https://polychat.co/s/ec163812-9323-4cb5-a429-7ddeaf3572c3\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://polychat.co/s/ec163812-9323-4cb5-a429-7ddeaf3572c3</a><p>Or you can share it publicly to the OpenWeb UI community<p><a href=\"https://openwebui.com/c/crizcraig/e1b2fff9-30a3-4ee7-8eed-b243bbc73b41\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://openwebui.com/c/crizcraig/e1b2fff9-30a3-4ee7-8eed-b2...</a><p>Finally we allow you to search and organize your chats into folders which makes finding things super fast!<p>Infra:\nMy custom backend that combines models and does things Open WebUI doesn't handle like token tracking is written in FastAPI and uses LiteLLM for easily accessing different model APIs. I host everything on GCP using Cloud Run for the backend and use PostGres for Open WebUI's db, along with BigQuery and Firestore for my FastAPI app's db.<p>Pricing:\nOur pricing makes it cheap to access top models. It's free at first, then we offer subscription tiers starting at $5/mo which allots about ~1 million tokens per month, enough for most people. But unlike Claude's UI for example, we don't shut you down with rate limits, but rather let heavy users upgrade beyond to $10, $20, $40, $80, etc... We also suggest a plan based on how quickly you used your free tokens, so you have an idea upfront of the monthly cost before you buy. And you can upgrade or downgrade at any time.<p>Thanks Show HN &lt;3"}, "title": {"matchLevel": "none", "matchedWords": [], "value": "Show HN: Chat with multiple LLMs: o1-high-effort, Sonnet 3.5, GPT-4o, and more"}, "url": {"matchLevel": "none", "matchedWords": [], "value": "https://polychat.co"}}, "_tags": ["story", "author_cr4zy", "story_42784373", "show_hn"], "author": "cr4zy", "children": [42784987, 42809012, 42809307, 42809358, 42809415, 42809471, 42809567, 42809881, 42810277, 42810310, 42810765, 42811310, 42811415, 42814227, 42814915, 42823091, 42911074], "created_at": "2025-01-21T19:40:44Z", "created_at_i": 1737488444, "num_comments": 33, "objectID": "42784373", "points": 62, "story_id": 42784373, "story_text": "Hello HN!

I did some scans with semgrep, and fixed some XSRF and CORS issues along with making sure the JWT tokens, passwords, etc\u2026 were secure. This was in addition to other folks&#x27; amazing security contributions. So now we build on Open WebUI! oss ftw<p>After launching privately a month or so ago and posting a few reddit links, I have about 100 users.<p>We also just got access to the o1 API and provide o1-high, medium, and low effort. o1 high effort is able to solve coding problems that only o1 pro can also solve, though pro can go further and has better formatting, o1 high effort is a nice option if you don&#x27;t want to fork over $200&#x2F;mo.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;OpenAI&#x2F;comments&#x2F;1i0r867&#x2F;comment&#x2F;m70xlsk&#x2F;?context=3\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;OpenAI&#x2F;comments&#x2F;1i0r867&#x2F;comment&#x2F;m70...</a><p>You can use o1 for free in PolyChat, which is the only place I&#x27;ve seen you can do so.<p>You can also ask multiple models the same question and stream the answers simultaneously side by side. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;ly5ZPh8\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;ly5ZPh8</a><p>And you can have multiple chats going simultaneously and they will continue in the background and notify you when they&#x27;re done.<p>Another cool feature that makes long chats way easier to navigate is the overview (three dots on top right of chat) <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;PoB1phT\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;PoB1phT</a><p>We give you full control, unlike most providers, to change the system prompt, temperature, etc.. in the chat settings in the &quot;Controls&quot; on the top right.<p>The formatting for code outputs and inputs is fantastic, using codemirror, and you can run code in the code blocks if it&#x27;s python or JS using in-browser runtimes.<p>You can also share chats within polychat where other logged in users can see them:<p>e.g. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;polychat.co&#x2F;s&#x2F;ec163812-9323-4cb5-a429-7ddeaf3572c3\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;polychat.co&#x2F;s&#x2F;ec163812-9323-4cb5-a429-7ddeaf3572c3</a><p>Or you can share it publicly to the OpenWeb UI community<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;openwebui.com&#x2F;c&#x2F;crizcraig&#x2F;e1b2fff9-30a3-4ee7-8eed-b243bbc73b41\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;openwebui.com&#x2F;c&#x2F;crizcraig&#x2F;e1b2fff9-30a3-4ee7-8eed-b2...</a><p>Finally we allow you to search and organize your chats into folders which makes finding things super fast!<p>Infra:\nMy custom backend that combines models and does things Open WebUI doesn&#x27;t handle like token tracking is written in FastAPI and uses LiteLLM for easily accessing different model APIs. I host everything on GCP using Cloud Run for the backend and use PostGres for Open WebUI&#x27;s db, along with BigQuery and Firestore for my FastAPI app&#x27;s db.<p>Pricing:\nOur pricing makes it cheap to access top models. It&#x27;s free at first, then we offer subscription tiers starting at $5&#x2F;mo which allots about ~1 million tokens per month, enough for most people. But unlike Claude&#x27;s UI for example, we don&#x27;t shut you down with rate limits, but rather let heavy users upgrade beyond to $10, $20, $40, $80, etc... We also suggest a plan based on how quickly you used your free tokens, so you have an idea upfront of the monthly cost before you buy. And you can upgrade or downgrade at any time.<p>Thanks Show HN &lt;3", "title": "Show HN: Chat with multiple LLMs: o1-high-effort, Sonnet 3.5, GPT-4o, and more", "updated_at": "2026-02-12T10:51:15Z",
