No bells and whistles, no Rust binaries, no serverless adapters, everything just works out of the box.\n\n**Drizzle is serverless-ready by design**. It works in every major JavaScript runtime like NodeJS, Bun, Deno, Cloudflare Workers, Supabase functions, any Edge runtime, and even in browsers.  \nWith Drizzle you can be [**fast out of the box**](https://orm.drizzle.team/benchmarks) and save time and costs while never introducing any data proxies into your infrastructure. \n\nWhile you can use Drizzle as a JavaScript library, it shines with TypeScript. It lets you [**declare SQL schemas**](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/sql-schema-declaration) and build both [**relational**](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/rqb) and [**SQL-like queries**](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/select), while keeping the balance between type-safety and extensibility for toolmakers to build on top.  \n\n### Ecosystem\nWhile Drizzle ORM remains a thin typed layer on top of SQL, we made a set of tools for people to have best possible developer experience.  \n  \nDrizzle comes with a powerful [**Drizzle Kit**](https://orm.drizzle.team/kit-docs/overview) CLI companion for you to have hassle-free migrations. It can generate SQL migration files for you or apply schema changes directly to the database.  \n  \nWe also have [**Drizzle Studio**](https://orm.drizzle.team/drizzle-studio/overview) for you to effortlessly browse and manipulate data in your database of choice.\n\n### Documentation\nCheck out the full documentation on [the website](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/overview).\n\n### Our sponsors \u2764\ufe0f\n<p align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"https://drizzle.team\" target=\"_blank\">\n<img src='https://api.drizzle.team/v2/sponsors/svg'/>\n</a>\n</p>\n"}
