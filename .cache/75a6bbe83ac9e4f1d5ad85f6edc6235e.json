Context\n\n'Tea' is an app that promotes itself as a tool for dating safety. In this platform, women are able to discuss their experiences dating men anonymously, with the ability to search specific man by name and identify potential red flags, criminal history or just do a general background check. It can be seen as an evolution of \"are we dating the same guy?\" facebook groups. To verify the identity of its users, they're asked to upload an ID and a selfie. The ID requirement was removed after 2023, according to app developers. It has recently gone viral, and due to its very nature it is extremely controversial.\n\nFirst reported by [404 Media](https://archive.is/y7J9Z), there was a data breach where thousands of photos and IDs of the app users were \"leaked\" to 4chan. However, there was no hacking involved, because the database was stored publicly, without any kind of encryption. Here's a [statement by the app developers](https://www.teaforwomen.com/cyberincident).\n\n# Reactions\n\nWhile some redditors worry about the privacy and safety of the women whose data was leaked, some others see it as karmic justice, considering the app itself as a tool for doxing men. Some others just see it as a badly developed app based on mostly \"vibe coding\". Fair warning, comments get pretty ugly, misoginistic and racist, so this migth not be everyone's cup of tea (ha!). Here's some selected popcorn:\n\n* [Is it karma?](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1m927j6/comment/n53w7z0/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n&gt;The doxxers become the doxxed, if karma exists this might be the clearest example.\n\n* For some reason, [discussion gets racial](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1m927j6/comment/n53u6cz/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button) (xenophobic might be a better word)\n\n&gt;You are a complete idiot if you upload your drivers license to services like this.
