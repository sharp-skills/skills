I'm launching Kvatch CLI v1.0.0-beta today \u2014 a tool that lets you query multiple data sources (Postgres, CSV, Google Sheets, APIs, etc.) as if they were a single SQL database.<p>Demo: <a href=\"https://github.com/kvatch-hub/kvatch-cli\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/kvatch-hub/kvatch-cli</a>\nDownload: <a href=\"https://github.com/kvatch-hub/kvatch-cli/releases/tag/v1.0.0-beta\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/kvatch-hub/kvatch-cli/releases/tag/v1.0.0...</a><p>## Why I Built This<p>As a data engineer, I got tired of the &quot;export-download-import-wrangle&quot; dance every time I needed to join data from different sources. The usual workflow:<p>1. Export from Postgres\n2. Download CSV from somewhere\n3. Grab data from Google Sheets\n4. Spend 3 hours in Python/Excel joining everything\n5. Fix encoding issues\n6. Realize you exported wrong columns\n7. Repeat<p>It's 2026. This shouldn't be so hard.<p>## What It Does<p>Define data sources in YAML and query across them with standard SQL:<p>```yaml\nconnectors:\n  - name: prod_db\n    type: postgres\n    connection: postgres://localhost/<em>production</em><p><pre><code>  - name: sales_data\n    type: csv\n    connection: ./sales.csv\n</code></pre>\ndatasets:\n  - name: analysis\n    query: |\n      SELECT u.name, s.revenue\n      FROM prod_db.users u\n      LEFT JOIN sales_data s ON u.id = s.user_id\n```<p>Run: `kvatch query --plan analysis.yaml`<p>Kvatch executes the query across sources and returns results \u2014 no exports, no intermediate files.<p>## Technical Approach<p>- Written in Go (single binary, ~12MB)\n- Uses SQL federation (not ETL \u2014 queries sources directly)\n- Local SQLite for caching/intermediate results\n- Pluggable connector architecture\n- Supports Postgres, MySQL, SQLite, CSV, JSON, Google Sheets, Git repos, REST APIs<p>Everything runs locally. Your data never leaves your machine.<p>## Current Status<p><em>Core</em> engine is <em>production</em>-ready (tested with real datasets), but calling it &quot;beta&quot; because I want feedback before v1.0. Some UX polish still needed (diagnostics commands, better logging, etc.).<p>Supported platforms: macOS (Intel + Apple Silicon), Linux (x86_64 + ARM64), Windows.<p>## What's Next<p>Building a paid &quot;remote mode&quot; for teams: shared plans, scheduled queries, web UI, access control. Local mode will stay free forever.<p>## Try It<p>```bash\nbrew tap kvatch-hub/tap\nbrew install kvatch<p># Or download: <a href=\"https://github.com/kvatch-hub/kvatch-cli/releases\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/kvatch-hub/kvatch-cli/releases</a><p>kvatch init\nkvatch query --plan examples/quickstart/plan.yaml\n```<p>Examples: <a href=\"https://github.com/kvatch-hub/kvatch-cli/tree/main/examples\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/kvatch-hub/kvatch-cli/tree/main/examples</a><p>Happy to answer questions!

I&#x27;m launching Kvatch CLI v1.0.0-beta today \u2014 a tool that lets you query multiple data sources (Postgres, CSV, Google Sheets, APIs, etc.) as if they were a single SQL database.<p>Demo: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;kvatch-hub&#x2F;kvatch-cli\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;kvatch-hub&#x2F;kvatch-cli</a>\nDownload: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;kvatch-hub&#x2F;kvatch-cli&#x2F;releases&#x2F;tag&#x2F;v1.0.0-beta\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;kvatch-hub&#x2F;kvatch-cli&#x2F;releases&#x2F;tag&#x2F;v1.0.0...</a><p>## Why I Built This<p>As a data engineer, I got tired of the &quot;export-download-import-wrangle&quot; dance every time I needed to join data from different sources. The usual workflow:<p>1. Export from Postgres\n2. Download CSV from somewhere\n3. Grab data from Google Sheets\n4. Spend 3 hours in Python&#x2F;Excel joining everything\n5. Fix encoding issues\n6. Realize you exported wrong columns\n7. Repeat<p>It&#x27;s 2026. This shouldn&#x27;t be so hard.<p>## What It Does<p>Define data sources in YAML and query across them with standard SQL:<p>```yaml\nconnectors:\n  - name: prod_db\n    type: postgres\n    connection: postgres:&#x2F;&#x2F;localhost&#x2F;production<p><pre><code>  - name: sales_data\n    type: csv\n    connection: .&#x2F;sales.csv\n</code></pre>\ndatasets:\n  - name: analysis\n    query: |\n      SELECT u.name, s.revenue\n      FROM prod_db.users u\n      LEFT JOIN sales_data s ON u.id = s.user_id\n```<p>Run: `kvatch query --plan analysis.yaml`<p>Kvatch executes the query across sources and returns results \u2014 no exports, no intermediate files.<p>## Technical Approach<p>- Written in Go (single binary, ~12MB)\n- Uses SQL federation (not ETL \u2014 queries sources directly)\n- Local SQLite for caching&#x2F;intermediate results\n- Pluggable connector architecture\n- Supports Postgres, MySQL, SQLite, CSV, JSON, Google Sheets, Git repos, REST APIs<p>Everything runs locally. Your data never leaves your machine.<p>## Current Status<p>Core engine is production-ready (tested with real datasets), but calling it &quot;beta&quot; because I want feedback before v1.0.
