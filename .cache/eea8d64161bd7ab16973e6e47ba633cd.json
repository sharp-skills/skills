It helps you chain together interoperable components and third-party integrations to simplify AI application development \u2013 all while future-proofing decisions as the underlying technology evolves.\n\n```bash\npip install langchain\n```\n\nIf you're looking for more advanced customization or agent orchestration, check out [LangGraph](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/overview), our framework for building controllable agent workflows.\n\n---\n\n**Documentation**:\n\n- [docs.langchain.com](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langchain/overview) \u2013 Comprehensive documentation, including conceptual overviews and guides\n- [reference.langchain.com/python](https://reference.langchain.com/python) \u2013 API reference docs for LangChain packages\n- [Chat LangChain](https://chat.langchain.com/) \u2013 Chat with the LangChain documentation and get answers to your questions\n\n**Discussions**: Visit the [LangChain Forum](https://forum.langchain.com) to connect with the community and share all of your technical questions, ideas, and feedback.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> Looking for the JS/TS library? Check out [LangChain.js](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchainjs).\n\n## Why use LangChain?\n\nLangChain helps developers build applications powered by LLMs through a standard interface for models, embeddings, vector stores, and more.\n\nUse LangChain for:\n\n- **Real-time data augmentation**. Easily connect LLMs to diverse data sources and external/internal systems, drawing from LangChain's vast library of integrations with model providers, tools, vector stores, retrievers, and more.\n- **Model interoperability**. Swap models in and out as your engineering team experiments to find the best choice for your application's needs. As the industry frontier evolves, adapt quickly \u2013 LangChain's abstractions keep you moving without losing momentum.\n- **Rapid prototyping**. Quickly build and iterate on LLM applications with LangChain's modular, component-based architecture. Test different approaches and workflows without rebuilding from scratch, accelerating your development cycle.\n- **Production-ready features**. Deploy reliable applications with built-in support for monitoring, evaluation, and debugging through integrations like LangSmith. Scale with confidence using battle-tested patterns and best practices.\n- **Vibrant community and ecosystem**. Leverage a rich ecosystem of integrations, templates, and community-contributed components. Benefit from continuous improvements and stay up-to-date with the latest AI developments through an active open-source community.\n- **Flexible abstraction layers**. Work at the level of abstraction that suits your needs - from high-level chains for quick starts to low-level components for fine-grained control. LangChain grows with your application's complexity.\n\n## LangChain ecosystem\n\nWhile the LangChain framework can be used standalone, it also integrates seamlessly with any LangChain product, giving developers a full suite of tools when building LLM applications.\n\nTo improve your LLM application development, pair LangChain with:\n\n- [Deep Agents](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagents) *(new!)* \u2013 Build agents that can plan, use subagents, and leverage file systems for complex tasks\n- [LangGraph](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/overview) \u2013 Build agents that can reliably handle complex tasks with LangGraph, our low-level agent orchestration framework. LangGraph offers customizable architecture, long-term memory, and human-in-the-loop workflows \u2013 and is trusted in production by companies like LinkedIn, Uber, Klarna, and GitLab.\n- [Integrations](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/integrations/providers/overview) \u2013 List of LangChain integrations, including chat & embedding models, tools & toolkits, and more\n- [LangSmith](https://www.langchain.com/langsmith) \u2013 Helpful for agent evals and observability. Debug poor-performing LLM app runs, evaluate agent trajectories, gain visibility in production, and improve performance over time.\n- [LangSmith Deployment](https://docs.langchain.com/langsmith/deployments) \u2013 Deploy and scale agents effortlessly with a purpose-built deployment platform for long-running, stateful workflows. Discover, reuse, configure, and share agents across teams \u2013 and iterate quickly with visual prototyping in [LangSmith Studio](https://docs.langchain.com/langsmith/studio).\n\n## Additional resources\n\n- [API Reference](https://reference.langchain.com/python) \u2013 Detailed reference on navigating base packages and integrations for LangChain.\n- [Contributing Guide](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/contributing/overview) \u2013 Learn how to contribute to LangChain projects and find good first issues.\n- [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/?tab=coc-ov-file) \u2013 Our community guidelines and standards for participation.\n- [LangChain Academy](https://academy.langchain.com/) \u2013 Comprehensive, free courses on LangChain libraries and products, made by the LangChain team.\n"}
