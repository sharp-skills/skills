available.\r\n\r\n## Key Highlights\r\n\r\nSee [What's new in Celery 5.6](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/history/whatsnew-5.6.html) for a complete overview or read the main highlights below.\r\n\r\n### Python 3.9 Minimum Version\r\n\r\nCelery 5.6.0 drops support for Python 3.8 (EOL). The minimum required Python version is now 3.9. Users still on Python 3.8 must upgrade their Python version before upgrading to Celery 5.6.0.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, this release includes initial support for Python 3.14.\r\n\r\n### SQS: Reverted to `pycurl` from `urllib3`\r\n\r\nThe switch from `pycurl` to `urllib3` for the SQS transport (introduced in Celery 5.5.0 via Kombu) has been reverted due to critical issues affecting SQS users.\r\n\r\nContributed by @auvipy in https://github.com/celery/celery/pull/9620.\r\n\r\n### Security Fix: Broker Credential Leak Prevention\r\n\r\nFixed a security issue where broker URLs containing passwords were being logged in plaintext by the delayed delivery mechanism. Broker credentials are now properly sanitized in all log output.\r\n\r\nContributed by @giancarloromeo in https://github.com/celery/celery/pull/9997.\r\n\r\n### Memory Leak Fixes\r\n\r\nTwo significant memory leaks have been fixed in this release:\r\n\r\n**Exception Handling Memory Leak**: Fixed a critical memory leak in task exception handling that was particularly severe on Python 3.11+ due to enhanced traceback data. The fix properly breaks reference cycles in tracebacks to allow garbage collection.\r\n\r\nContributed by @jaiganeshs21 in https://github.com/celery/celery/pull/9799.\r\n\r\n**Pending Result Memory Leak**: Fixed a memory leak where `AsyncResult` subscriptions were not being cleaned up when results were forgotten.\r\n\r\nContributed by @tsoos99dev in https://github.com/celery/celery/pull/9806.\r\n\r\n### ETA Task Memory Limit\r\n\r\nNew configuration option `worker_eta_task_limit` to prevent out-of-memory crashes when workers fetch large numbers of ETA or countdown tasks. Previously, workers could exhaust available memory when the broker contained many scheduled tasks.\r\n\r\nExample usage:\r\n\r\n```python\r\napp.conf.worker_eta_task_limit = 1000\r\n```\r\n\r\nContributed by @sashu2310 in https://github.com/celery/celery/pull/9853.\r\n\r\n### Queue Type Selection for Auto-created Queues\r\n\r\nNew configuration options allow specifying the queue type and exchange type when Celery auto-creates missing queues. This is particularly useful for RabbitMQ users who want to use quorum queues with auto-created queues.\r\n\r\nConfiguration options:\r\n\r\n- `task_create_missing_queue_type`: Sets the queue type for auto-created queues (e.g., `quorum`, `classic`)\r\n- `task_create_missing_queue_exchange_type`: Sets the exchange type for auto-created queues\r\n\r\nExample usage:\r\n\r\n```python\r\napp.conf.task_create_missing_queue_type = 'quorum'\r\n```\r\n\r\nContributed by @ghirailghiro in https://github.com/celery/celery/pull/9815.\r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n\r\n* Prepare for release: v5.6.0 by @Nusnus in https://github.com/celery/celery/pull/10010\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/celery/celery/compare/v5.6.0rc2...v5.6.0\r\n",
