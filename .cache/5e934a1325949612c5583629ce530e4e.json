Do more in parallel\n\nSpin up 3-5 git worktrees, each running its own Claude session. This is the single biggest productivity unlock from the team. Some people set up shell aliases (za, zb, zc) to hop between worktrees in one keystroke.\n\n# 2. Start every complex task in plan mode\n\nPour your energy into the plan so Claude can one-shot the implementation. If something goes sideways, switch back to plan mode and re-plan instead of pushing through. One person even spins up a second Claude to review the plan as a staff engineer.\n\n# 3. Invest in your [CLAUDE.md](http://CLAUDE.md)\n\nAfter every correction, tell Claude: \"Update your CLAUDE.md so you don't make that mistake again.\" Claude is eerily good at writing rules for itself. Keep iterating until Claude's mistake rate measurably drops.\n\n# 4. Create your own skills and commit them to git\n\nIf you do something more than once a day, turn it into a skill or slash command. Examples from the team: a `/techdebt` command to find duplicated code, a command that syncs Slack/GDrive/Asana/GitHub into one context dump, and analytics agents that write dbt models.\n\n# 5. Claude fixes most bugs by itself\n\nPaste a Slack bug thread into Claude and just say \"fix.\" Or say \"Go fix the failing CI tests.\" Don't micromanage how. You can also point Claude at docker logs to troubleshoot distributed systems.\n\n# 6. Level up your prompting\n\nChallenge Claude - say \"Grill me on these changes and don't make a PR until I pass your test.\" After a mediocre fix, say \"Knowing everything you know now, scrap this and implement the elegant solution.\" Write detailed specs and reduce ambiguity - the more specific, the better the output.\n\n# 7. Terminal and environment setup\n\nThe team loves Ghostty. Use `/statusline` to show context usage and git branch. Color-code your terminal tabs. Use voice dictation - you speak 3x faster than you type (hit fn twice on macOS).\n\n# 8. Use subagents\n\nSay \"use subagents\" when you want Claude to throw more compute at a problem. Offload tasks to subagents to keep your main context window clean. You can also route permission requests to Opus 4.5 via a hook to auto-approve safe ones.\n\n# 9. Use Claude for data and analytics\n\nUse Claude with the `bq` CLI (or any database CLI/MCP/API) to pull and analyze metrics. Boris says he hasn't written a line of SQL in 6+ months.\n\n# 10. Learning with Claude\n\nEnable the \"Explanatory\" or \"Learning\" output style in `/config` to have Claude explain the why behind its changes. You can also have Claude generate visual HTML presentations, draw ASCII diagrams of codebases, or build a spaced-repetition learning skill.\n\nI resonate with a lot of these tips, so I recommend trying out at least a few of them.

Each day, the system scrapes close to 100 AI news stories off the internet \u2192 saves the stories in a data lake as markdown file \u2192 and then runs those through this n8n workflow to generate a final newsletter that gets sent out to the subscribers.\n\nI\u2019ve been iterating on the main prompts used in this workflow over the past 5 months and have got it to the point where it is handling 95% of the process for writing each edition of the newsletter. It currently automatically handles:\n\n- Scraping news stories sourced all over the internet from Twitter / Reddit / HackerNews / AI Blogs / Google News Feeds\n- Loading all of those stories up and having an \"AI Editor\" pick the top 3-4 we want to feature in the newsletter\n- Taking the source material and actually writing each core newsletter segment\n- Writing all of the supplementary sections like the intro + a \"Shortlist\" section that includes other AI story links\n- Formatting all of that output as markdown so it is easy to copy into Beehiiv and schedule with a few clicks\n\nWhat started as an interesting pet project AI newsletter now has several thousand subscribers and has an open rate above 20%\n\n## Data Ingestion Workflow Breakdown\n\nThis is the foundation of the newsletter system as I wanted complete control of where the stories are getting sourced from and need the content of each story in an easy to consume format like markdown so I can easily prompt against it. I wrote a bit more about this automation on this [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/n8n/comments/1kzaysv/i_built_a_workflow_to_scrape_virtually_any_news/) but will cover the key parts again here:\n\n1. The approach I took here involves creating a \"feed\" using RSS.app for every single news source I want to pull stories from (Twitter / Reddit / HackerNews / AI Blogs / Google News Feed / etc).\n    1. Each feed I create gives an endpoint I can simply make an HTTP request to get a list of every post / content piece that rss.app was able to extract.\n    2. With enough feeds configured, I\u2019m confident that I\u2019m able to detect every major story in the AI / Tech space for the day.\n2. After a feed is created in rss.app, I wire it up to the n8n workflow on a Scheduled Trigger that runs every few hours to get the latest batch of news stories.\n3. Once a new story is detected from that feed, I take that list of urls given back to me and start the process of scraping each one:\n    1. This is done by calling into a\u00a0`scrape_url`\u00a0sub-workflow that I built out. This uses the Firecrawl API\u00a0`/scrape`\u00a0endpoint to scrape the contents of the news story and returns its text content back in markdown format\n4. Finally, I take the markdown content that was scraped for each story and save it into an S3 bucket so I can later query and use this data when it is time to build the prompts that write the newsletter.\n\nSo by the end any given day with these scheduled triggers running across a dozen different feeds, I end up scraping close to 100 different AI news stories that get saved in an easy to use format that I will later prompt against.\n\n## Newsletter Generator Workflow Breakdown\n\nThis workflow is the big one that actually loads up all scraped news content, picks the top stories, and writes the full newsletter.\n\n### 1. Trigger / Inputs\n\n- I use an n8n form trigger that simply let\u2019s me pick the date I want to generate the newsletter for\n- I can optionally pass in the previous day\u2019s newsletter text content which gets loaded into the prompts I build to write the story so I can avoid duplicated stories on back to back days.\n\n### 2. Loading Scraped News Stories from the Data Lake\n\nOnce the workflow is started, the first two sections are going to load up all of the news stories that were scraped over the course of the day. I do this by:\n\n- Running a simple search operation on our S3 bucket prefixed by the date like: `2025-06-10/` (gives me all stories scraped on June 10th)\n- Filtering these results to only give me back the markdown files that end in an `.md` extension (needed because I am also scraping and saving the raw HTML as well)\n- Finally read each of these files and load the text content of each file and format it nicely so I can include that text in each prompt to later generate the newsletter.\n\n### 3. AI Editor Prompt\n\nWith all of that text content in hand, I move on to the\u00a0**AI Editor**\u00a0section of the automation responsible for picking out the top 3-4 stories for the day relevant to the audience. This prompt is very specific to what I\u2019m going for with this specific content, so if you want to build something similar you should expect\u00a0***a lot***\u00a0of trial and error to get this to do what you want to. It's pretty beefy.\n\n- Once the top stories are selected, that selection is shared in a slack channel using a \"Human in the loop\" approach where it will wait for me to approve the selected stories or provide feedback.\n- For example, I may disagree with the top selected story on that day and I can type out in plain english to \"Look for another story in the top spot, I don't like it for XYZ reason\".\n- The workflow will either look for my approval or take my feedback into consideration and try selecting the top stories again before continuing on.\n\n### 4. Subject Line Prompt\n\nOnce the top stories are approved, the automation moves on to a very similar step for writing the subject line. It will give me its top selected option and 3-5 alternatives for me to review. Once again this get's shared to slack, and I can approve the selected subject line or tell it to use a different one in plain english.\n\n### 5. Write \u201cCore\u201d Newsletter Segments\n\nNext up, I move on to the part of the automation that is responsible for writing the \"core\" content of the newsletter. There's quite a bit going on here:\n\n- The action inside this section of the workflow is to split out each of the stop news stories from before and start looping over them. This allows me to write each section one by one instead of needing a prompt to one-shot the entire thing. In my testing, I found this to follow my instructions / constraints in the prompt much better.\n- For each top story selected, I have a list of \"content identifiers\" attached to it which corresponds to a file stored in the S3 bucket. Before I start writing, I go back to our S3 bucket and download each of these markdown files so the system is only looking at and passing in the relevant context when it comes time to prompt. The number of tokens used on the API calls to LLMs get very big when passing in all news stories to a prompt so this should be as focused as possible.\n- With all of this context in hand, I then make the LLM call and run a mega-prompt that is setup to generate a single core newsletter section. The core newsletter sections follow a very structured format so this was relatively easier to prompt against (compared to picking out the top stories). If that is not the case for you, you may need to get a bit creative to vary the structure / final output.\n- This process repeats until I have a newsletter section written out for each of the top selected stories for the day.\n\nYou may have also noticed there is a branch here that goes off and will conditionally try to scrape more URLs. We do this to try and scrape more \u201cprimary source\u201d materials from any news story we have loaded into context. \n\nSay Open AI releases a new model and the story we scraped was from Tech Crunch.

Each day, the system scrapes close to 100 AI news stories off the internet \u2192 saves the stories in a data lake as markdown file \u2192 and then runs those through this n8n workflow to generate a final newsletter that gets sent out to the subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019ve been iterating on the main prompts used in this workflow over the past 5 months and have got it to the point where it is handling 95% of the process for writing each edition of the newsletter. It currently automatically handles:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Scraping news stories sourced all over the internet from Twitter / Reddit / HackerNews / AI Blogs / Google News Feeds&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Loading all of those stories up and having an &amp;quot;AI Editor&amp;quot; pick the top 3-4 we want to feature in the newsletter&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Taking the source material and actually writing each core newsletter segment&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Writing all of the supplementary sections like the intro + a &amp;quot;Shortlist&amp;quot; section that includes other AI story links&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Formatting all of that output as markdown so it is easy to copy into Beehiiv and schedule with a few clicks&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What started as an interesting pet project AI newsletter now has several thousand subscribers and has an open rate above 20%&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Data Ingestion Workflow Breakdown&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is the foundation of the newsletter system as I wanted complete control of where the stories are getting sourced from and need the content of each story in an easy to consume format like markdown so I can easily prompt against it. I wrote a bit more about this automation on this &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/n8n/comments/1kzaysv/i_built_a_workflow_to_scrape_virtually_any_news/\"&gt;reddit post&lt;/a&gt; but will cover the key parts again here:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The approach I took here involves creating a &amp;quot;feed&amp;quot; using RSS.app for every single news source I want to pull stories from (Twitter / Reddit / HackerNews / AI Blogs / Google News Feed / etc).\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Each feed I create gives an endpoint I can simply make an HTTP request to get a list of every post / content piece that rss.app was able to extract.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;With enough feeds configured, I\u2019m confident that I\u2019m able to detect every major story in the AI / Tech space for the day.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;After a feed is created in rss.app, I wire it up to the n8n workflow on a Scheduled Trigger that runs every few hours to get the latest batch of news stories.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Once a new story is detected from that feed, I take that list of urls given back to me and start the process of scraping each one:\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;This is done by calling into a\u00a0&lt;code&gt;scrape_url&lt;/code&gt;\u00a0sub-workflow that I built out. This uses the Firecrawl API\u00a0&lt;code&gt;/scrape&lt;/code&gt;\u00a0endpoint to scrape the contents of the news story and returns its text content back in markdown format&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Finally, I take the markdown content that was scraped for each story and save it into an S3 bucket so I can later query and use this data when it is time to build the prompts that write the newsletter.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So by the end any given day with these scheduled triggers running across a dozen different feeds, I end up scraping close to 100 different AI news stories that get saved in an easy to use format that I will later prompt against.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Newsletter Generator Workflow Breakdown&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This workflow is the big one that actually loads up all scraped news content, picks the top stories, and writes the full newsletter.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;1. Trigger / Inputs&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I use an n8n form trigger that simply let\u2019s me pick the date I want to generate the newsletter for&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I can optionally pass in the previous day\u2019s newsletter text content which gets loaded into the prompts I build to write the story so I can avoid duplicated stories on back to back days.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;2. Loading Scraped News Stories from the Data Lake&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once the workflow is started, the first two sections are going to load up all of the news stories that were scraped over the course of the day. I do this by:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Running a simple search operation on our S3 bucket prefixed by the date like: &lt;code&gt;2025-06-10/&lt;/code&gt; (gives me all stories scraped on June 10th)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Filtering these results to only give me back the markdown files that end in an &lt;code&gt;.md&lt;/code&gt; extension (needed because I am also scraping and saving the raw HTML as well)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Finally read each of these files and load the text content of each file and format it nicely so I can include that text in each prompt to later generate the newsletter.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;3. AI Editor Prompt&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With all of that text content in hand, I move on to the\u00a0&lt;strong&gt;AI Editor&lt;/strong&gt;\u00a0section of the automation responsible for picking out the top 3-4 stories for the day relevant to the audience. This prompt is very specific to what I\u2019m going for with this specific content, so if you want to build something similar you should expect\u00a0&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;\u00a0of trial and error to get this to do what you want to. It&amp;#39;s pretty beefy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Once the top stories are selected, that selection is shared in a slack channel using a &amp;quot;Human in the loop&amp;quot; approach where it will wait for me to approve the selected stories or provide feedback.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;For example, I may disagree with the top selected story on that day and I can type out in plain english to &amp;quot;Look for another story in the top spot, I don&amp;#39;t like it for XYZ reason&amp;quot;.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The workflow will either look for my approval or take my feedback into consideration and try selecting the top stories again before continuing on.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;4. Subject Line Prompt&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once the top stories are approved, the automation moves on to a very similar step for writing the subject line. It will give me its top selected option and 3-5 alternatives for me to review. Once again this get&amp;#39;s shared to slack, and I can approve the selected subject line or tell it to use a different one in plain english.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;5. Write \u201cCore\u201d Newsletter Segments&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Next up, I move on to the part of the automation that is responsible for writing the &amp;quot;core&amp;quot; content of the newsletter. There&amp;#39;s quite a bit going on here:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The action inside this section of the workflow is to split out each of the stop news stories from before and start looping over them. This allows me to write each section one by one instead of needing a prompt to one-shot the entire thing. In my testing, I found this to follow my instructions / constraints in the prompt much better.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;For each top story selected, I have a list of &amp;quot;content identifiers&amp;quot; attached to it which corresponds to a file stored in the S3 bucket. Before I start writing, I go back to our S3 bucket and download each of these markdown files so the system is only looking at and passing in the relevant context when it comes time to prompt. The number of tokens used on the API calls to LLMs get very big when passing in all news stories to a prompt so this should be as focused as possible.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;With all of this context in hand, I then make the LLM call and run a mega-prompt that is setup to generate a single core newsletter section. The core newsletter sections follow a very structured format so this was relatively easier to prompt against (compared to picking out the top stories). If that is not the case for you, you may need to get a bit creative to vary the structure / final output.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;This process repeats until I have a newsletter section written out for each of the top selected stories for the day.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You may have also noticed there is a branch here that goes off and will conditionally try to scrape more URLs. We do this to try and scrape more \u201cprimary source\u201d materials from any news story we have loaded into context. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Say Open AI releases a new model and the story we scraped was from Tech Crunch. It\u2019s unlikely that tech crunch is going to give me all details necessary to really write something really good about the new model so I look to see if there\u2019s a url/link included on the scraped page back to the Open AI blog or some other announcement post.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In short, I just want to get as many primary sources as possible here and build up better context for the main prompt that writes the newsletter section.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;6. Final Touches (Final Nodes / Sections)&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I have a prompt to generate an intro section for the newsletter based off all of the previously generated content\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I then have a prompt to generate a newsletter section called &amp;quot;The Shortlist&amp;quot; which creates a list of other AI stories that were interesting but didn&amp;#39;t quite make the cut for top selected stories&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Lastly, I take the output from all previous node, format it as markdown, and then post it into an internal slack channel so I can copy this final output and paste it into the Beehiiv editor and schedule to send for the next morning.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Workflow Link + Other Resources&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Github workflow links:\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;AI News Story / Data Ingestion Workflow: &lt;a href=\"https://github.com/lucaswalter/n8n-ai-workflows/blob/main/ai_news_data_ingestion.json\"&gt;https://github.com/lucaswalter/n8n-ai-workflows/blob/main/ai_news_data_ingestion.json&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Firecrawl Scrape Url Sub-Workflow: &lt;a href=\"https://github.com/lucaswalter/n8n-ai-workflows/blob/main/firecrawl_scrape_url.json\"&gt;https://github.com/lucaswalter/n8n-ai-workflows/blob/main/firecrawl_scrape_url.json&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;AI Newsletter Generator Workflow: &lt;a href=\"https://github.com/lucaswalter/n8n-ai-workflows/blob/main/ai_newsletter_generator.json\"&gt;https://github.com/lucaswalter/n8n-ai-workflows/blob/main/ai_newsletter_generator.json&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;YouTube video that walks through this workflow step-by-step:\u00a0&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nv5_LU0q1IY\"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nv5_LU0q1IY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also wanted to share that my team and I run a free Skool community called\u00a0&lt;a href=\"https://www.skool.com/ai-automation-mastery-group\"&gt;AI Automation Mastery&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0where we build and share the automations we are working on.

I don't ever want to play Planning Poker again. I don't ever want to wake up to find out that my most recent implementation is outdated because another super hot LLM has dropped overnight. I don't ever want to pretend to be proficient in yet another framework because the one I've been using is not cool anymore. I don't ever want to google how to revert a commit after pushing to remote again. I don't want to update oh-my-zsh every other day!!!!!!!!! I don't want to say \"I'm still working on it but I've made a lot of progress\" when in reality I haven't opened VSCode in three days because I'm sick of it. I don't want to discuss which IDE is best, I don't want to be stuck on a customer's API just to find out their documentation is completely wrong, I don't want to run into issue after issue until I can't remember what the actual task was anymore, I don't ever want to run out of GPU in Colab again. I don't want to have to check 5 different browsers to see if a margin is applied correctly. I don't ever want to compare model cards on huggingface again, I don't ever want to adjust parameters again, I don't ever want to refactor a single line of code again, I don't want to read another completely redundant comment other people's code because it was created by ChatGPT or Copilot. I don't want to see another component that is illegible because it is stuffed with tailwind. I don't want to discuss UX with stakeholders who apparently have never used an application in their lives. I don't want to be automatically labelled as  frontend and UX expert simply because I am a woman. I don't want to have to explain that the problem isn't the AI but the badly maintained data. I don't want to write a single Readme .md again. I don't want to write another prompt in my life. I don't want to restart another jupyter notebook ever again. I don't ever want to npm install again, I don't ever want to pip install -r requirements.txt just to run into dependency hell, and I don't want to take minutes every time I look for a previous message because I can't remember if it's in slack, teams, or discord. I don't want to write another word on a sticky note in miro and I don't want to look for \"the gif that best describes my mood\" either. I don't want to read another sentence on the world wide web that contains any of the words \"enhance\", \"leverage\", \"delve\". I don't want to \"embark\" or \"indulge\".\n\nI hate the internet. I have completely lost the ability to concentrate for longer than a couple of minutes. I have two monitors in addition to my laptop, I swipe between multiple desktops and it's still not enough for showing my emails, calendar, slack, teams, chatgpt, my IDE which in itself is separated into the main view and three different terminal tabs, the mongodb compass, postman, a browser window for googling, a browser window for compiling, a million other browser windows for github, jira, confluence, gcp or aws, and MY NOTES APP BECAUSE I DON'T REMEMBER A SINGLE THING ANYMORE.\n\nI know that a lot of these issues are directly related to my workplace, but I have tried all kinds of setups and also working independently, and I am done. Open for any job suggestions that do not involve any of the above. Also open for any additions to this list.\n\n Edit: UPDATE\n\nPeople of reddit, you are incredible! I did not expect this to be read and commented on by so many people. And I am honestly touched by the sympathy, concern and advice in your responses. I will try to reply to as many as possible in the next couple of days. Not sure whether to be happy or sad to see that so many people feel the same, but I am glad that some of your were able to improve their situation, be it in a new position or a completely new field of work.\n\nMost of you have suggested burnout, and I agree that it is time for a break for me (as soon as I can afford it). In the long run, I am still considering changing profession. I feel like my brain is just not suitable for doing all these things at once. I started programming because I did enjoy solving problems and the abstract thinking that is needed. But the IT world just seems too fast-paced for me.

I am a web developer with some knowledge in NLP, meaning I&amp;#39;ve been working on AI things too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But. I simply cannot do it anymore. I don&amp;#39;t ever want to hear the word &amp;quot;agile&amp;quot; again. I don&amp;#39;t ever want to play Planning Poker again. I don&amp;#39;t ever want to wake up to find out that my most recent implementation is outdated because another super hot LLM has dropped overnight. I don&amp;#39;t ever want to pretend to be proficient in yet another framework because the one I&amp;#39;ve been using is not cool anymore. I don&amp;#39;t ever want to google how to revert a commit after pushing to remote again. I don&amp;#39;t want to update oh-my-zsh every other day!!!!!!!!! I don&amp;#39;t want to say &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m still working on it but I&amp;#39;ve made a lot of progress&amp;quot; when in reality I haven&amp;#39;t opened VSCode in three days because I&amp;#39;m sick of it. I don&amp;#39;t want to discuss which IDE is best, I don&amp;#39;t want to be stuck on a customer&amp;#39;s API just to find out their documentation is completely wrong, I don&amp;#39;t want to run into issue after issue until I can&amp;#39;t remember what the actual task was anymore, I don&amp;#39;t ever want to run out of GPU in Colab again. I don&amp;#39;t want to have to check 5 different browsers to see if a margin is applied correctly. I don&amp;#39;t ever want to compare model cards on huggingface again, I don&amp;#39;t ever want to adjust parameters again, I don&amp;#39;t ever want to refactor a single line of code again, I don&amp;#39;t want to read another completely redundant comment other people&amp;#39;s code because it was created by ChatGPT or Copilot. I don&amp;#39;t want to see another component that is illegible because it is stuffed with tailwind. I don&amp;#39;t want to discuss UX with stakeholders who apparently have never used an application in their lives. I don&amp;#39;t want to be automatically labelled as  frontend and UX expert simply because I am a woman. I don&amp;#39;t want to have to explain that the problem isn&amp;#39;t the AI but the badly maintained data. I don&amp;#39;t want to write a single Readme .md again. I don&amp;#39;t want to write another prompt in my life. I don&amp;#39;t want to restart another jupyter notebook ever again. I don&amp;#39;t ever want to npm install again, I don&amp;#39;t ever want to pip install -r requirements.txt just to run into dependency hell, and I don&amp;#39;t want to take minutes every time I look for a previous message because I can&amp;#39;t remember if it&amp;#39;s in slack, teams, or discord. I don&amp;#39;t want to write another word on a sticky note in miro and I don&amp;#39;t want to look for &amp;quot;the gif that best describes my mood&amp;quot; either. I don&amp;#39;t want to read another sentence on the world wide web that contains any of the words &amp;quot;enhance&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;leverage&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;delve&amp;quot;. I don&amp;#39;t want to &amp;quot;embark&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;indulge&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hate the internet. I have completely lost the ability to concentrate for longer than a couple of minutes. I have two monitors in addition to my laptop, I swipe between multiple desktops and it&amp;#39;s still not enough for showing my emails, calendar, slack, teams, chatgpt, my IDE which in itself is separated into the main view and three different terminal tabs, the mongodb compass, postman, a browser window for googling, a browser window for compiling, a million other browser windows for github, jira, confluence, gcp or aws, and MY NOTES APP BECAUSE I DON&amp;#39;T REMEMBER A SINGLE THING ANYMORE.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know that a lot of these issues are directly related to my workplace, but I have tried all kinds of setups and also working independently, and I am done. Open for any job suggestions that do not involve any of the above. Also open for any additions to this list.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: UPDATE&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People of reddit, you are incredible! I did not expect this to be read and commented on by so many people. And I am honestly touched by the sympathy, concern and advice in your responses. I will try to reply to as many as possible in the next couple of days. Not sure whether to be happy or sad to see that so many people feel the same, but I am glad that some of your were able to improve their situation, be it in a new position or a completely new field of work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Most of you have suggested burnout, and I agree that it is time for a break for me (as soon as I can afford it). In the long run, I am still considering changing profession. I feel like my brain is just not suitable for doing all these things at once. I started programming because I did enjoy solving problems and the abstract thinking that is needed. But the IT world just seems too fast-paced for me. The jobs I had before, where I had to physically do something (mostly service and hospitality industry) were exhausting and at times it was hard not to hate people, but they weren\u2019t frying my brain in the way that is is being fried now. It came with a different kind of satisfaction, and I guess this is something that differs from person to person.\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also appreciate the people who took the time to tell me to suck it up.
