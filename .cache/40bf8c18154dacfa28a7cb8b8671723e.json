I.e.:<p>- user/tenant management. Oauth + email/password, 2-factor, mail/sms flows for reset, etc. \n- plan/package management + RBAC / access control + rate limiting and/or overcharges on pay-per-use basis\n- connection to payment provider(s). Say Stripe + Paypal for pretty good coverage. Needs to cover correct VAT handling\n- exposed self-service userprofile / saas-preferences / payment options / billing statements / 'currently accrued this month' statement, etc. \n  - might be API only. Community will take it from there with canned Gui templates using bootstrap, etc. \n- ...<p><em>Auth0</em> for instance tackles the user-management space pretty nicely, and it might make sense for this Saas-for-Saas to optionally outsource that part to them for all the extra stuff they provide (LDAP, etc). However, just as an example using multiple users under 1 tenant-account is not straightforward.<p>So why is it that such a Saas-for-Saas doesn't exist? Do startups hesitate to outsource this core-functionality? Do they just wing it, and later pull their hair out when realising that doing it properly takes far more time than anticipated? Or is selling to the startup-crowd just really tough?<p>Lastly to note: It doesn't have to be a Saas per-se. Could just as well be open-source code with a commercial license or something. It would have to run entirely separate from my own saas-code, but that's perfectly doable.

I.e.:<p>- user&#x2F;tenant management. Oauth + email&#x2F;password, 2-factor, mail&#x2F;sms flows for reset, etc. \n- plan&#x2F;package management + RBAC &#x2F; access control + rate limiting and&#x2F;or overcharges on pay-per-use basis\n- connection to payment provider(s). Say Stripe + Paypal for pretty good coverage. Needs to cover correct VAT handling\n- exposed self-service userprofile &#x2F; saas-preferences &#x2F; payment options &#x2F; billing statements &#x2F; &#x27;currently accrued this month&#x27; statement, etc. \n  - might be API only. Community will take it from there with canned Gui templates using bootstrap, etc. \n- ...<p>Auth0 for instance tackles the user-management space pretty nicely, and it might make sense for this Saas-for-Saas to optionally outsource that part to them for all the extra stuff they provide (LDAP, etc). However, just as an example using multiple users under 1 tenant-account is not straightforward.<p>So why is it that such a Saas-for-Saas doesn&#x27;t exist? Do startups hesitate to outsource this core-functionality? Do they just wing it, and later pull their hair out when realising that doing it properly takes far more time than anticipated? Or is selling to the startup-crowd just really tough?<p>Lastly to note: It doesn&#x27;t have to be a Saas per-se. Could just as well be open-source code with a commercial license or something.
