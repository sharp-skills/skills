Every grid, form, and workflow now looks sharper and feels better, without changing how you work.

Webhook Custom Payloads are no longer Cloud-only\u2014this powerful capability is now available in NocoDB Community Edition. Shape your webhook requests exactly the way your integrations need them. Cleaner payloads, smarter automations, and seamless connections with any external system.

Filters can now be reordered using drag-and-drop, giving you better control and faster iteration while building views.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"800\" height=\"371\" alt=\"reorder-filter\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9fef84ec-aa66-48e6-aa88-72d25a5d9913\" />\r\n\r\n- Percent values lacked precision control: Percent fields were limited in how precisely values could be represented. Added precision support for Percent fields, allowing you to define decimal accuracy for cleaner calculations and clearer data presentation.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1084\" height=\"642\" alt=\"percent-precision\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9cc6718e-c852-413d-803f-90f851718acf\" />\r\n\r\n- Default view was locked to Grid: Tables always opened in Grid view, even when another view was more relevant. You can now set any view as the default for a table, ensuring users land directly on the most meaningful view.\r\n\r\n- Commenters and viewers had full toolbar access: Limited-access roles were exposed to advanced actions. Commenter and Viewer roles now work in a simplified interface without toolbar access, keeping the experience focused, secure, and role-appropriate.\r\n\r\nAddressed several bug fixes and improved security.\r\n\r\n---\r\n### \ud83d\udce2 License Update\r\n\r\n> TL;DR: If your use of NocoDB is not to offer a commercial service, nothing changes for you. Keep using it exactly as you do today. We're making this move so we can give you more and not less.\r\n\r\nStarting with this release, NocoDB is transitioning its license from AGPL 3.0 to a Fair-code\u2013based Sustainable Use License. This change is designed to protect the long-term sustainability of the project while keeping NocoDB open, transparent, and community-driven. The Fair-code model has resonated strongly across the open-source and no-code communities, with projects adopting this approach now collectively representing over 170,000+ GitHub stars : a signal that sustainable open-source business models are not just viable, but thriving. The new license continues to allow free use, modification, and self-hosting, while placing reasonable limits on commercial offerings. \r\n\r\n\ud83d\udc49 View the full license terms [here](https://github.com/nocodb/nocodb?tab=License-1-ov-file#readme)\r\n\r\nThis step helps ensure that innovation in NocoDB is funded, maintained, and driven by the community for the long run.\r\n\r\n### \u26a0\ufe0f Breaking Change\r\n\r\nUsing **base names** and **table names** in API endpoints is no longer supported.  \r\nAll API integrations must now use **IDs** instead of names.\r\n\r\nIncluding names as part of API paths is **highly discouraged**, as names can be changed by other users, which may break existing integrations unexpectedly.\r\n\r\n#### Before\r\n\r\n`http://localhost:8081/api/v1/db/data/noco/Getting%20Started/Table-1`\r\n\r\n#### After\r\n`http://localhost:8081/api/v1/db/data/noco/pjq0r488d4gt2xz/mtan85lkqcvf8i7`\r\n\r\n---\r\n### Bug fixes\r\n\r\n- [**closed**] \ud83d\udd26 Feature: Dark mode enable button [#12800](https://github.com/nocodb/nocodb/issues/12800)\r\n- [**closed**] \u8bf7\u95ee\u53ef\u4ee5\u624b\u52a8\u7f16\u5199SQL\u8bed\u53e5\u8fdb\u884c\u67e5\u8be2\u5417\uff1f [#12797](https://github.com/nocodb/nocodb/issues/12797)\r\n- [**closed**] \ud83d\udc1b Bug: Import table fails silently when there are emojis in \"List Single Select\" from Airtable [#12794](https://github.com/nocodb/nocodb/issues/12794)\r\n- [**closed**] \ud83d\udc1b Bug: it doesn't allow me to export in .json format [#12791](https://github.com/nocodb/nocodb/issues/12791)\r\n- [**closed**] \ud83d\udc1b Bug: Internal Error when converting Text column with Default Value to SingleSelect [#12780](https://github.com/nocodb/nocodb/issues/12780)\r\n- [**closed**] docs(i18n): add Turkish translation for README [#12775](https://github.com/nocodb/nocodb/issues/12775)\r\n- [**closed**] Inconsistent protocol in README for Auto-upstall script [#12771](https://github.com/nocodb/nocodb/issues/12771)\r\n- [**closed**] Need to update Holiday Schedule for 2026 [#12763](https://github.com/nocodb/nocodb/issues/12763)\r\n- [**closed**] \ud83d\udc1b Bug: airtable import missing description [#12761](https://github.com/nocodb/nocodb/issues/12761)\r\n- [**closed**] \ud83d\udc1b Bug: Webhook not containing all rows when copy & paste rows into a table.
