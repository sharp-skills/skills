It combines vector similarity search with keyword filtering, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and reranking in a single query interface. Common use cases include RAG systems, semantic and image search, recommendation engines, chatbots, and content classification.\n\nWeaviate supports two approaches to store vectors: automatic vectorization at import using [integrated models](https://docs.weaviate.io/weaviate/model-providers) (OpenAI, Cohere, HuggingFace, and others) or direct import of [pre-computed vector embeddings](https://docs.weaviate.io/weaviate/starter-guides/custom-vectors). Production deployments benefit from built-in multi-tenancy, replication, RBAC authorization, and [many other features](#weaviate-features).\n\nTo get started quickly, have a look at one of these tutorials:\n\n- [Quickstart - Weaviate Cloud](https://docs.weaviate.io/weaviate/quickstart)\n- [Quickstart - local Docker instance](https://docs.weaviate.io/weaviate/quickstart/local)\n\n## Installation\n\nWeaviate offers multiple installation and deployment options:\n\n- [Docker](https://docs.weaviate.io/deploy/installation-guides/docker-installation)\n- [Kubernetes](https://docs.weaviate.io/deploy/installation-guides/k8s-installation)\n- [Weaviate Cloud](https://console.weaviate.cloud)\n\nSee the [installation docs](https://docs.weaviate.io/deploy) for more deployment options, such as [AWS](https://docs.weaviate.io/deploy/installation-guides/aws-marketplace) and [GCP](https://docs.weaviate.io/deploy/installation-guides/gcp-marketplace).\n\n## Getting started\n\nYou can easily start Weaviate and a local vector embedding model with [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/).\nCreate a `docker-compose.yml` file:\n\n```yml\nservices:\n  weaviate:\n    image: cr.weaviate.io/semitechnologies/weaviate:1.36.0\n    ports:\n      - \"8080:8080\"\n      - \"50051:50051\"\n    environment:\n      ENABLE_MODULES: text2vec-model2vec\n      MODEL2VEC_INFERENCE_API: http://text2vec-model2vec:8080\n\n  # A lightweight embedding model that will generate vectors from objects during import\n  text2vec-model2vec:\n    image: cr.weaviate.io/semitechnologies/model2vec-inference:minishlab-potion-base-32M\n```\n\nStart Weaviate and the embedding service with:\n\n```bash\ndocker compose up -d\n```\n\nInstall the Python client (or use another [client library](#client-libraries-and-apis)):\n\n```bash\npip install -U weaviate-client\n```\n\nThe following Python example shows how easy it is to populate a Weaviate database with data, create vector embeddings and perform semantic search:\n\n```python\nimport weaviate\nfrom weaviate.classes.config import Configure, DataType, Property\n\n# Connect to Weaviate\nclient = weaviate.connect_to_local()\n\n# Create a collection\nclient.collections.create(\n    name=\"Article\",\n    properties=[Property(name=\"content\", data_type=DataType.TEXT)],\n    vector_config=Configure.Vectors.text2vec_model2vec(),  # Use a vectorizer to generate embeddings during import\n    # vector_config=Configure.Vectors.self_provided()  # If you want to import your own pre-generated embeddings\n)\n\n# Insert objects and generate embeddings\narticles = client.collections.get(\"Article\")\narticles.data.insert_many(\n    [\n        {\"content\": \"Vector databases enable semantic search\"},\n        {\"content\": \"Machine learning models generate embeddings\"},\n        {\"content\": \"Weaviate supports hybrid search capabilities\"},\n    ]\n)\n\n# Perform semantic search\nresults = articles.query.near_text(query=\"Search objects by meaning\", limit=1)\nprint(results.objects[0])\n\nclient.close()\n```\n\nThis example uses the `Model2Vec` vectorizer, but you can choose any other [embedding model provider](https://docs.weaviate.io/weaviate/model-providers) or [bring your own pre-generated vectors](https://docs.weaviate.io/weaviate/starter-guides/custom-vectors).\n\n## Client libraries and APIs\n\nWeaviate provides client libraries for several programming languages:\n\n- [Python](https://docs.weaviate.io/weaviate/client-libraries/python)\n- [JavaScript/TypeScript](https://docs.weaviate.io/weaviate/client-libraries/typescript)\n- [Java](https://docs.weaviate.io/weaviate/client-libraries/java)\n- [Go](https://docs.weaviate.io/weaviate/client-libraries/go)\n- [C#/.NET](https://docs.weaviate.io/weaviate/client-libraries/csharp)\n\nThere are also additional [community-maintained libraries](https://docs.weaviate.io/weaviate/client-libraries/community).\n\nWeaviate exposes [REST API](https://docs.weaviate.io/weaviate/api/rest), [gRPC API](https://docs.weaviate.io/weaviate/api/grpc), and [GraphQL API](https://docs.weaviate.io/weaviate/api/graphql) to communicate with the database server.\n\n## Weaviate features\n\nThese features enable you to build AI-powered applications:\n\n- **\u26a1 Fast Search Performance**: Perform complex semantic [searches](https://docs.weaviate.io/weaviate/search/similarity) over billions of vectors in milliseconds. Weaviate's architecture is built in Go for speed and reliability, ensuring your AI applications are highly responsive even under heavy load. See our [ANN benchmarks](https://docs.weaviate.io/weaviate/benchmarks/ann) for more info.\n\n- **\ud83d\udd0c Flexible Vectorization**: Seamlessly vectorize data at import time with [integrated vectorizers](https://docs.weaviate.io/weaviate/model-providers) from OpenAI, Cohere, HuggingFace, Google, and more. Or you can import [your own vector embeddings](https://docs.weaviate.io/weaviate/starter-guides/custom-vectors).\n\n- **\ud83d\udd0d Advanced Hybrid & Image Search**: Combine the power of semantic search with traditional [keyword (BM25) search](https://docs.weaviate.io/weaviate/search/bm25), [image search](https://docs.weaviate.io/weaviate/search/image) and [advanced filtering](https://docs.weaviate.io/weaviate/search/filters) to get the best results with a single API call.\n\n- **\ud83e\udd16 Integrated RAG & Reranking**: Go beyond simple retrieval with built-in [generative search (RAG)](https://docs.weaviate.io/weaviate/search/generative) and [reranking](https://docs.weaviate.io/weaviate/search/rerank) capabilities. Power sophisticated Q&A systems, chatbots, and summarizers directly from your database without additional tooling.\n\n- **\ud83d\udcc8 Production-Ready & Scalable**: Weaviate is built for mission-critical applications. Go from rapid prototyping to production at scale with native support for [horizontal scaling](https://docs.weaviate.io/deploy/configuration/horizontal-scaling), [multi-tenancy](https://docs.weaviate.io/weaviate/manage-collections/multi-tenancy), [replication](https://docs.weaviate.io/deploy/configuration/replication), and fine-grained [role-based access control (RBAC)](https://docs.weaviate.io/weaviate/configuration/rbac).\n\n- **\ud83d\udcb0 Cost-Efficient Operations**: Radically lower resource consumption and operational costs with built-in [vector compression](https://docs.weaviate.io/weaviate/configuration/compression). Vector quantization and multi-vector encoding reduce memory usage with minimal impact on search performance.\n\n- **\u23f1\ufe0f Object TTL**: Automatically expire and remove stale data with configurable [time-to-live](https://docs.weaviate.io/weaviate/manage-collections/time-to-live) settings per collection, with full RBAC and multi-tenancy support.\n\nFor a complete list of all functionalities, visit the [official Weaviate documentation](https://docs.weaviate.io).\n\n## Useful resources\n\n### AI Agent Skills\n\n[Weaviate Agent Skills](https://github.com/weaviate/agent-skills) is a collection of skills for AI coding agents (Claude Code, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, and others) that enable them to work with Weaviate more accurately and efficiently. Skills cover searching, querying, collection management, data import, and full application blueprints (RAG, agentic RAG, chatbots, and more).\n\nInstall with:\n\n```bash\nnpx skills add weaviate/agent-skills\n```\n\n### Demo projects & recipes\n\nThese demos are working applications that highlight some of Weaviate's capabilities.
