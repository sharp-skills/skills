[Lodash](https://lodash.com/) became the [most depended on](https://gist.github.com/anvaka/8e8fa57c7ee1350e3491#file-01-most-dependent-upon-md) npm package, passed [1 billion](http://npm-stat.com/charts.html?package=&author=jdalton) downloads, & its v3 release saw massive adoption!\n\nThe year was also one of collaboration, as discussions began on [merging Lodash & Underscore](https://github.com/underdash/underdash/issues/14). Much of Lodash v4 is proofing out the ideas from those discussions. Lodash v4 **would not be possible** without the collaboration & contributions of the Underscore core team. In the spirit of merging our teams have blended with [several members](https://github.com/orgs/lodash/people) contributing to both libraries.\n\nFor 2016 & [lodash v4.0.0](https://github.com/lodash/lodash/wiki/Changelog#v400) we wanted to cut loose, push forward, & take things up a notch!\n\n## Modern only\n\nWith v4 we\u2019re breaking free from [old projects](https://github.com/lodash-archive), old environments, & dropping [old IE < 9 support](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/WindowsForBusiness/End-of-IE-support)!\n\n## 4 kB Core\n\nLodash\u2019s kitchen-sink size will continue to grow as new methods & functionality are added. However, we now offer a 4 kB (gzipped) [core build](https://github.com/lodash/lodash/tree/4.0.0/dist) that\u2019s compatible with [Backbone v1.2.4](https://github.com/jashkenas/backbone/issues/3839) for folks who want Lodash without lugging around the kitchen sink.\n\n## More ES6\n\nWe\u2019ve continued to embrace ES6 with methods like [_.isSymbol](https://lodash.com/docs#isSymbol), added support for cloning & comparing array buffers, maps, sets, & symbols, converting iterators to arrays, & iterable `_(\u2026)`.\n\nIn addition, we\u2019ve published an [es-build](https://github.com/lodash/lodash/tree/4.0.0-es/) & pulled [babel-plugin-lodash](https://github.com/lodash/babel-plugin-lodash) into core to make tree-shaking a breeze.\n\n## More Modular\n\nPop quiz! \ud83d\udce3\n\nWhat category path does the `bindAll` method belong to? Is it \n\nA) `require('lodash/function/bindAll')`\nB) `require('lodash/utility/bindAll')`\nC) `require('lodash/util/bindAll')`\n\nDon\u2019t know? Well, with v4 it doesn\u2019t matter because now module paths are as simple as\n\n``` js\nvar bindAll = require('lodash/bindAll');\n```\n\nWe\u2019ve also reduced module complexity making it easier to create smaller bundles. This has helped Lodash adoption with libraries like [Async](https://github.com/caolan/async/pull/996) & [Redux](https://github.com/rackt/redux/pull/611)!\n\n## 1st Class FP\n\nWith v3 we introduced [lodash-fp](https://github.com/lodash-archive/lodash-fp). We learned a lot & with v4 we decided to [pull it into core](https://github.com/lodash/lodash/wiki/FP-Guide).\n\nNow you can get immutable, auto-curried, iteratee-first, data-last methods as simply as\n\n``` js\nvar _ = require('lodash/fp');\nvar object = { 'a': 1 };\nvar source = { 'b': 2 };\nvar newObject = _.assign(source)(object);\n\nconsole.log(newObject);\n// => { 'a': 1, 'b': 2 }\n\nconsole.log(object);\n// => { 'a': 1 }\n\nvar convert = require('lodash/fp/convert');\nvar assign = convert('assign', require('lodash.assign'));\n// works too!\n```\n\n## Chakra Optimized\n\nWell actually, while we\u2019re [excited about Chakra](https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2016/01/13/chakracore-now-open/), Lodash is optimized for great performance across **all engines**. Unlike many libraries, we don\u2019t favor a single engine so we can deliver solid performance & support regardless of engine.\n\nWith v4 we\u2019ve continued our commitment to performance; expanding support for lazy evaluation & improving the performance of core functionality like circular reference detection.\n\n## Emojis\n\nTaking things up a notch Lodash v4 has added support for emojis! Includes things like\n[astral symbols](https://twitter.com/jdalton/status/643438391498010624), [unicode modifiers](https://twitter.com/jdalton/status/647236920448172032),  [variation selector characters](https://twitter.com/jdalton/status/645144377229078528), [zero-width joiners](https://twitter.com/jdalton/status/644783287508926464), & [regional indicator symbols](https://twitter.com/jdalton/status/644781038221201408).\n\n<img src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4303/12280603/077c73ba-b944-11e5-900c-8463f8680612.png\">\n\n## Breaking changes\n\nWe\u2019ve introduced more breaking changes in this release than any other so be sure to check out the [changelog](https://github.com/lodash/lodash/wiki/Changelog#compatibility-warnings) for a full rundown of changes & give [lodash-migrate](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lodash-migrate) a spin to help migrate older Lodash code to the latest release.\n\nIf you dig Lodash don\u2019t forget to [star the repo](https://github.com/lodash/lodash/stargazers) or `npm star lodash`!\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/lodash/lodash/releases/2416102/reactions", "total_count": 14, "+1": 7, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 1, "confused": 0, "heart": 2, "rocket": 4, "eyes": 0}}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/lodash/lodash/releases/886192", "assets_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/lodash/lodash/releases/886192/assets", "upload_url": "https://uploads.github.com/repos/lodash/lodash/releases/886192/assets{?name,label}", "html_url": "https://github.com/lodash/lodash/releases/tag/3.0.0", "id": 886192, "author": {"login": "jdalton", "id": 4303, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjQzMDM=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4303?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jdalton", "html_url": "https://github.com/jdalton", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jdalton/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jdalton/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jdalton/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jdalton/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jdalton/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jdalton/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jdalton/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jdalton/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jdalton/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "node_id": "MDc6UmVsZWFzZTg4NjE5Mg==", "tag_name": "3.0.0", "target_commitish": "master", "name": "3.0.0", "draft": false, "immutable": false, "prerelease": false, "created_at": "2015-02-05T06:15:03Z", "updated_at": "2021-02-20T11:50:27Z", "published_at": "2015-01-26T17:50:39Z", "assets": [], "tarball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/lodash/lodash/tarball/3.0.0", "zipball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/lodash/lodash/zipball/3.0.0", "body": "# lodash v3.0.0\r\n\r\nAfter a little over a year & more than [2,000](https://github.com/lodash/lodash/graphs/contributors?from=2013-12-01&type=c) [commits](https://github.com/lodash/lodash-cli/graphs/contributors?from=2013-12-01&type=c) we\u2019re excited to release [lodash v3.0.0](https://github.com/lodash/lodash/tree/3.0.0). lodash follows [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/) so with this major release we\u2019ve taken the opportunity to clean house & make [some back-compat breaking changes](https://github.com/lodash/lodash/wiki/Changelog#compatibility-warnings). We\u2019ll get into that in a bit, but first lets talk about all the cool things this release has to offer.\r\n\r\n## String methods\r\n\r\nBy popular demand we surveyed the utility landscape for a cross-section of string APIs to add to lodash. We settled on 17 string methods:\r\n[_.camelCase](https://lodash.com/docs#camelCase), [_.capitalize](https://lodash.com/docs#capitalize), [_.deburr](https://lodash.com/docs#deburr), [_.endsWith](https://lodash.com/docs#endsWith), [_.escapeRegExp](https://lodash.com/docs#escapeRegExp),\r\n[_.kebabCase](https://lodash.com/docs#kebabCase), [_.pad](https://lodash.com/docs#pad), [_.padLeft](https://lodash.com/docs#padLeft), [_.padRight](https://lodash.com/docs#padRight), [_.repeat](https://lodash.com/docs#repeat), [_.snakeCase](https://lodash.com/docs#snakeCase),\r\n[_.startsWith](https://lodash.com/docs#startsWith), [_.trim](https://lodash.com/docs#trim), [_.trimLeft](https://lodash.com/docs#trimLeft), [_.trimRight](https://lodash.com/docs#trimRight), [_.trunc](https://lodash.com/docs#trunc), & [_.words](https://lodash.com/docs#words)\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s familiar methods from ES5, like `_.trim`, & ES6, like `_.endsWith`, `_.repeat`, & `_.startsWith`, as well as some lesser known methods like `_.deburr` & `_.kebabCase`.\r\n\r\n``` js\r\n// trims whitespace like `String#trim` but\r\n// also allows specifying characters to trim\r\n_.trim('  abc  ');\r\n// \u2192 'abc'\r\n_.trim('-_-abc-_-', '_-');\r\n// \u2192 'abc'\r\n\r\n// works great with `_.map` too\r\n_.map(['  foo  ', '  bar  '], _.trim);\r\n// \u2192 ['foo', 'bar']\r\n\r\n// deburr diacritical marks (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diacritic)\r\n_.deburr('d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu');\r\n// \u2192 'deja vu'\r\n\r\n// similar to a `dasherize` or `slugify` method\r\n_.kebabCase('foo bar');\r\n// \u2192 'foo-bar'\r\n```\r\n\r\nFollowing casing rules with methods like `_.camelCase`, `_.kebabCase`, & `_.snakeCase` allows for strings to be transformed from say camel case, to kebab case, to snake case, & back again.\r\n\r\n``` js\r\n_.camelCase(_.snakeCase(_.kebabCase('fooBar')));\r\n// \u2192 'fooBar'\r\n```\r\n\r\n## ES is our jam\r\n\r\nPrevious versions of lodash added `_.assign`, `_.find`, `_.findIndex`, & ES template delimiter support. In this release we\u2019re taking our ES adoption up a notch by aligning `_.includes`, `_.isFinite`, & `_.keys`, supporting typed arrays in `_.clone` & `_.isEqual`, using `Set` & `WeakMap` for [performance](http://jsperf.com/array-object-unique/2#chart=bar)-[gains](http://jsperf.com/weakmap-wrap#chart=bar), allowing `Map` & `WeakMap` to be used as [_.memoize.Cache](https://lodash.com/docs/#memoize), & supporting [ES modularized builds](https://github.com/lodash/lodash/tree/3.0.0-es) with [lodash-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lodash-cli).\r\n\r\n## Functional goodies\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s lots of functional goodies in v3 like `_.ary`, `_.curryRight`, `_.flow`, `_.rearg`, & support for customizable argument placeholders in `_.bind`, `_.bindKey`, `_.curry`, `_.curryRight`, `_.partial`, & `_.partialRight`.\r\n\r\n``` js\r\n// infomercial fail\r\n_.map(['6', '8', '10'], parseInt);\r\n// \u2192 [6, NaN, 2]\r\n\r\n// using a placeholder to pass over the\r\n// `string` parameter & specify a `radix` of `0`\r\n_.map(['6', '8', '10'], _.partial(parseInt, _, 0));\r\n// \u2192 [6, 8, 10]\r\n\r\n// is equivalent to\r\n_.map(['6', '8', '10'], function(value) {\r\n  return parseInt(value, 0);\r\n});\r\n\r\n// customize `_.partial.placeholder`\r\n_.partial.placeholder = '_';\r\n_.map(['6', '8', '10'], _.partial(parseInt, '_', 0));\r\n// \u2192 [6, 8, 10]\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso several methods now [work out-of-the-box](https://github.com/lodash/lodash/wiki/Changelog#notable-changes) as iteratees for methods like `_.map` & `_.reduce`\r\n\r\n``` js\r\n_.map(['6', '8', '10'], _.parseInt);\r\n// \u2192 [6, 8, 10]\r\n\r\n_.map(['a', 'a'], ['b', 'b'], _.uniq);\r\n// \u2192 [['a'], ['b']]\r\n\r\n_.reduce([{ 'b': 2 }, { 'c': 3 }], _.assign, { 'a': 1 });\r\n// \u2192 { 'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe\u2019ve heard from some functional programming fans that lodash wasn\u2019t _functional enough_, often citing our method signatures as an issue. To ease composition & currying they\u2019d prefer methods like `_.filter` be `predicate` first & `collection` second instead of `collection` first & `predicate` second.\r\n\r\n![Butter-side up](http://cdn.static.ovimg.com/episode/3092831.jpg)\r\n\r\nIt\u2019d be a shame for those fans to lose out on lodash over something as little as method signatures so with v3 we\u2019ve added `_.ary` & `_.rearg`. The `_.ary` method sets the argument cap of a function & `_.rearg` rearranges the arguments provided to a function.\r\n\r\n``` js\r\n// cap the number arguments provided to `parseInt` at one\r\n_.map(['6', '8', '10'], _.ary(parseInt, 1));\r\n// \u2192 [6, 8, 10]\r\n\r\n// create a `filter` that\u2019s predicate-first\r\nvar filter = _.rearg(_.filter, 1, 0);\r\nfilter('a', [{ 'a': 0 }, { 'a': 1 }]);\r\n// \u2192 [{ 'a': 1 }]\r\n\r\n// create an `includes` that\u2019s auto-curried & needle-first\r\nvar includes = _(_.includes).ary(2).rearg(1, 0).curry(2).value();\r\nincludes(2)([1, 2, 3]);\r\n// \u2192 true\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can also use individual packages like [lodash.ary](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lodash.ary), [lodash.curry](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lodash.curry), & [lodash.rearg](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lodash.rearg) to convert functions.\r\n\r\n``` js\r\nvar ary = require('lodash.ary'),\r\n    curry = require('lodash.curry'),\r\n    rearg = require('lodash.rearg');\r\n\r\nvar getobject = require('getobject'),\r\n    get = curry(rearg(ary(getobject, 2), [1, 0]), 2);\r\n\r\nget('a.b.c')({ 'a': { 'b': { 'c': 'foo' } } });\r\n// \u2192 'foo'\r\n```\r\n\r\nCombined with [_.runInContext](https://lodash.com/docs#runInContext) you could easily create a version of lodash with auto-curried iteratee-first methods. In fact, that\u2019s what [we\u2019ve done](https://github.com/lodash/lodash-fp/blob/0.1.0/index.js)! Introducing [lodash-fp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lodash-fp).\r\n\r\n``` js\r\nvar items = [\r\n  { 'value': _.constant(['a', 'b']) },\r\n  { 'value': _.constant(['b', 'c']) }\r\n];\r\n\r\nvar getValues = _.flow(\r\n  _.map(_.result('value')),\r\n  _.flatten,\r\n  _.uniq\r\n);\r\n\r\ngetValues(items);\r\n// => ['a', 'b', 'c']\r\n\r\n_.map(parseInt)(['6', '08', '10']);\r\n// \u2192 [6, 8, 10]\r\n```\r\n\r\nlodash reduces the cost of method wrapping produced by `_.ary`, `_.curry`, & `_.rearg`  by using a `WeakMap` to store function metadata. In this way a function is only wrapped once even though it may have `_.ary`, `_.curry`, & `_.rearg` applied.  \r\n\r\n## Modules, modules, modules\r\n\r\nIn lodash v2 we introduced [npm packages](https://www.npmjs.com/browse/keyword/lodash-modularized) per-method as well as bundles of modules for AMD & Node.js. With v3 we\u2019ve improved [lodash-cli\u2019s](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lodash-cli) ability to inline dependencies allowing us to easily customize inlining per method, enabling a better balance between deep dependency graphs & code duplication.\r\n\r\n<table><tbody>\r\n<tr><td valign=\"top\">\r\n<img src=\"http://f.cl.ly/items/2P1g0x0d0u2q3N0d022J/v2-dep-graph.png\" alt=\"v2 dep graph\">\r\n</td><td valign=\"top\">\r\n<img src=\"http://f.cl.ly/items/1i3D3E0k0W1L1M1Z1k2w/v3-dep-graph.png\" alt=\"v3 dep graph\">\r\n</td></tr>\r\n</tbody></table>\r\n\r\nIn addition all modularized dependencies now use the `^` version range, instead of the `~`, so they\u2019ll update as needed without you having to worry about it. Moving forward all per-method packages will be independently updated, instead of in bulk, because `lodash-cli` will soon be able to detect changes in packages & automatically bump patch/minor version numbers.\r\n\r\nThe [lodash](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lodash) & [lodash-compat](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lodash-compat) npm packages now come with modules baked in too.\r\nPerfect for [browserify](http://browserify.org/) and [webpack](http://webpack.github.io/)!\r\n\r\n``` js\r\n// load the modern build\r\nvar _ = require('lodash');\r\n// or a method category\r\nvar array = require('lodash/array');\r\n// or a method\r\nvar chunk = require('lodash/array/chunk');\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe method modules are organized by category so they\u2019re [easy to find](https://lodash.com/docs).\r\n\r\nlodash is available in a variety of other builds & module formats.\r\n- npm packages for [modern](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lodash), [compatibility](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lodash-compat), & [per method](https://www.npmjs.com/browse/keyword/lodash-modularized) builds\r\n- AMD modules for [modern](https://github.com/lodash/lodash/tree/3.0.0-amd) & [compatibility](https://github.com/lodash/lodash-compat/tree/3.0.0-amd) builds\r\n- ES modules for the [modern](https://github.com/lodash/lodash/tree/3.0.0-es) build\r\n\r\n## Performance\r\n\r\nWe\u2019ve improved performance 20-40% overall in v3 by better utilizing the JIT in JavaScript engines, using internal helper functions that avoid optimization disqualifications & increase the likelihood of function inlining.\r\n\r\n![performance comparison v3 vs v2](http://f.cl.ly/items/421w03451o322E1i1Y0S/perf-compare.png)\r\n\r\nIn v3 we\u2019ve also introduced [lazily evaluated](http://filimanjaro.com/blog/2014/introducing-lazy-evaluation/) chaining for [massive performance wins](http://jsperf.com/lazy-demo#chart=bar) in certain scenarios.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned above we\u2019re using `Set` & `WeakMap` for [performance](http://jsperf.com/array-object-unique/2#chart=bar)-[gains](http://jsperf.com/weakmap-wrap#chart=bar) which all modern browsers, Node.js, & io.js can benefit from.\r\n\r\n## Breaking changes\r\n\r\nlodash v3 is a major bump & we\u2019ve introduced several back-compat breaking changes. One such change is that while we still [test against](https://saucelabs.com/u/lodash) Underscore/Backbone unit tests we\u2019re no longer supporting an Underscore/Backbone build. Over the last year we\u2019ve seen Underscore align more & more with lodash\u2019s API so the need for a separate Underscore build has diminished. If you still need compatibility around some of the edges we recommend leveraging modules in lodash v3  to supplement your Underscore use.\r\n\r\nBe sure to check out the [changelog](https://github.com/lodash/lodash/wiki/Changelog#compatibility-warnings-1) for a full rundown of changes & give  [lodash-migrate](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lodash-migrate) a spin to help migrate older lodash code to the latest release.\r\n\r\n## New Core Member\r\n\r\nIn closing I want to welcome [Benjamin Tan](https://twitter.com/bnjmnt4n) ([bnjmnt4n](https://github.com/bnjmnt4n)) as an official core member.\r\nWithout the efforts of [contributors](https://github.com/lodash/lodash/graphs/contributors), like Benjamin, lodash v3 would not have happened.\r\n\r\nIf you dig lodash v3 don't forget to star the repo or `npm star lodash`!\r\n"}]}
