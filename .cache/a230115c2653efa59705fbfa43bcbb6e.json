While Plaid successfully achieved its goal, from an architecture point of view, it lacks all features that would make it a modular, scalable, testable and maintainable app: with UI logic in Android classes, no tests and only one module. \nPlaid represents a great real world app example: it provides a fairly complex set of functionalities, it has technical debt, it has features that have to be dealt with as APIs are being removed.\nAll of these problems are encountered by many projects in the Android community and therefore, make Plaid a suitable showcase for all the advantages that architecture components bring. \n\n#### More information\n\n* Read more:\n\n\t* [Restitching Plaid - Updating Plaid to modern app standards](https://medium.com/@crafty/restitching-plaid-9ca5588d3b0a)\n\t* [A patchwork Plaid - Monolith to modularized app](https://medium.com/androiddevelopers/a-patchwork-plaid-monolith-to-modularized-app-60235d9f212e)\n\t* [Cross-stitching Plaid and AndroidX](https://medium.com/androiddevelopers/cross-stitching-plaid-and-androidx-7603a192348e)\n\t* [Dependency injection in a multi module project](https://medium.com/androiddevelopers/dependency-injection-in-a-multi-module-project-1a09511c14b7)\n\n* Video Presentations:\n\n\t* [Shaping Your App's Architecture with Kotlin and Architecture Components by Florina](https://youtu.be/Sy6ZdgqrQp0) (Florina Muntenescu at KotlinConf 2018)\n\t* [Re-stitching Plaid with Kotlin](https://youtu.be/NNWejxBORgc) (Florina Muntenescu at Android Dev Summit '18)\n\n### Goals\n* Migrate Plaid to Architecture Components. The refactoring will follow the architecture described in [Guide to App Architecture](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/docs/guide).  \n* Convert to Kotlin, while migrating to Architecture Components.\n* Modularize the app using [dynamic feature modules](https://developer.android.com/guide/app-bundle/).\n* Showcase the extensibility of the architecture by adding an extra data source, once the migration is finished.\n\n### Non-Goals\nChanges to the styles, themes, icons, animations, transitions or any other UI elements that were the initial focus of Plaid, are outside the scope of this refactoring. \n\n### Android Studio IDE setup\n\nPlaid requires Android Studio version 3.6 or higher.\n\nPlaid uses [ktlint](https://ktlint.github.io/) to enforce Kotlin coding styles.\nHere's how to configure it for use with Android Studio (instructions adapted\nfrom the ktlint [README](https://github.com/shyiko/ktlint/blob/master/README.md)):\n\n- Close Android Studio if it's open\n- Download ktlint using these [installation instructions](https://github.com/shyiko/ktlint/blob/master/README.md#installation)\n\n- Inside the project root directory run:\n\n  `./ktlint --apply-to-idea-project --android`\n\n- Remove ktlint if desired:\n\n  `rm ktlint`\n\n- Start Android Studio\n\n---\n\n# Plaid 1.0\n\n<img src=\"screenshots/plaid_demo.gif\" width=\"300\" align=\"right\" hspace=\"20\">\n\n*Design news and inspiration.*\n\nPlaid is a showcase of [material design](https://www.google.com/design/spec/) that we hope you will\nkeep installed. It pulls in news & inspiration from [Designer News](https://www.designernews.co/),\n[Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/) & [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/). It demonstrates\nthe use of\n[material principles](https://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html#introduction-principles)\nto create tactile, bold, understandable UIs.\n\n**[Install on Google Play (Beta Testing)](https://play.google.com/apps/testing/io.plaidapp)**\n\n\n### Screenshots\n\n\n<img src=\"screenshots/home_grid_framed.png\" width=\"25%\" />\n<img src=\"screenshots/post_story_framed.png\" width=\"25%\" />\n<img src=\"screenshots/dn_story_framed.png\" width=\"25%\" />\n<img src=\"screenshots/dribbble_shot_framed.png\" width=\"25%\" />\n\n\n##### Non-Goals\nPlaid is a UI sample and seeks to demonstrate how to implement material design. To make this as clear as possible it explicitly does not attempt to:\n* Provide opinionated **architecture/testing** advice; it utilizes vanilla Android components. For advice on this, I'd recommend [Blueprints](https://github.com/googlesamples/android-architecture).\n* Support **pre-Lollipop** devices. Doing so is entirely possible, but complicates things. For advice on doing this, see [this fork](https://github.com/hzsweers/plaid/tree/z/moarbackport).\n\n\n### License\n\n\n```\nCopyright 2015 Google LLC.\n\nLicensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one or more contributor\nlicense agreements.
