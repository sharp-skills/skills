I.e.:<p>- user/tenant management. Oauth + email/password, 2-factor, mail/sms flows for reset, etc. \n- plan/package management + RBAC / access control + rate limiting and/or overcharges on pay-per-use basis\n- connection to payment provider(s). Say Stripe + <em>Paypal</em> for pretty good coverage. Needs to cover correct VAT handling\n- exposed self-service userprofile / saas-preferences / payment options / billing statements / 'currently accrued this month' statement, etc. \n  - might be API only. Community will take it from there with canned Gui templates using bootstrap, etc. \n- ...<p>Auth0 for instance tackles the user-management space pretty nicely, and it might make sense for this Saas-for-Saas to optionally outsource that part to them for all the extra stuff they provide (LDAP, etc). However, just as an example using multiple users under 1 tenant-account is not straightforward.<p>So why is it that such a Saas-for-Saas doesn't exist?
