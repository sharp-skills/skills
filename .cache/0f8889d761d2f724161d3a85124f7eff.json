The Framework compiles agent resources to CloudFormation with least-privilege IAM roles, builds and uploads Docker images to ECR, and supports both JavaScript and Python runtimes. New CLI commands include `sls invoke -a <agent>` (with JSON and SSE streaming), `sls logs -a <agent>`, and `sls dev` mode for agents with hot-reload. Includes 20+ example agents covering LangGraph, MCP servers, browser automation, code interpreters, and more. Read more in the [AI Agents documentation](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/agents).

The Framework now automatically selects the matching AWS Lambda runtime (e.g., local Node.js 22 -> `nodejs22.x`), and falls back to `nodejs20.x` with a warning when the local version isn't supported by Lambda. (#13355, #13362)\r\n\r\n- **Added JSDoc descriptions to the configuration schema for TypeScript type generation.** All JSON Schema properties across 30+ config schema files now include `description`, `@see`, `@example`, `@default`, `@deprecated`, and `@since` annotations. This enables auto-generated TypeScript type definitions (via [serverless/typescript](https://github.com/serverless/typescript)) with rich inline documentation, hover tooltips, and link-to-docs support in IDEs. (#13345)\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n### Serverless Framework\r\n\r\n- **Fixed Python packaging with `uv` failing when the root project is included in requirements.** Without `--no-emit-project`, `uv export` included the root project as an editable dependency (`-e .`) in the generated `requirements.txt`, causing `uv pip install` to fail inside Docker containers where `pyproject.toml` is not present. The Framework now passes `--no-emit-project` to exclude it. Read more in the [Python support guide](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/python).

HTTP API and WebSocket domains use API Gateway V2, which does not support this setting.\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n### Serverless Framework\r\n\r\n- **Fixed Dev Mode connection breakage from large MQTT payloads.** Requests or responses exceeding AWS IoT Core's 128 KB MQTT payload limit would silently break the connection, leaving the CLI in a zombie state where it appeared connected but all subsequent invocations failed. The Framework now checks payload sizes proactively and returns clear error messages instead of breaking the connection. (#13313)\r\n- **Fixed S3 upload failure when deploying symlinked artifacts.** AWS SDK v3 uses `lstatSync` to determine file size for multipart uploads, which returns the symlink size instead of the target file size. This caused \"Expected N part(s) but uploaded M part(s)\" errors when plugins like serverless-python-requirements cache artifacts as symlinks. The Framework now passes an explicit `ContentLength` to S3.
