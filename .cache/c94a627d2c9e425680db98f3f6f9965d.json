Let's call them used car price and used car color. Nothing will be <em>pushed</em> to <em>production</em> for several months. The first offshore gets excited about this plain vanilla request and states that we will start capturing these back end data points but that he should hop into the Xcode and start making front end changes now. Then the second offshore gets excited and writes that not only can they do that, but they can improve the signup flow by ditching social login for Twilio login with the additional two attributes of used car price and used car color as personal identifiers in the login process (wtf).<p>I asked for none of this. I made a very simple request (I think). Some days I feel like a comedy routine is going on, other days I feel like I'm being gaslit.

I have also been banned from two subreddits for asking it. So I&#x27;m taking out the country in question so as to make the whole thing more palatable.<p>Why do offshore developers &quot;race ahead&quot;? I&#x27;ve never understood this. There must be a sociological reason, right?<p>For example, I ask for a database to be reconfigured to capture two new user data points. Let&#x27;s call them used car price and used car color. Nothing will be pushed to production for several months. The first offshore gets excited about this plain vanilla request and states that we will start capturing these back end data points but that he should hop into the Xcode and start making front end changes now. Then the second offshore gets excited and writes that not only can they do that, but they can improve the signup flow by ditching social login for Twilio login with the additional two attributes of used car price and used car color as personal identifiers in the login process (wtf).<p>I asked for none of this. I made a very simple request (I think). Some days I feel like a comedy routine is going on, other days I feel like I&#x27;m being gaslit. And they&#x27;re not paid an hourly to ask questions, so they&#x27;re not emptying our pockets. But they aren&#x27;t &quot;idea people&quot; so what&#x27;s up with the random ideas? The work when done is competent. But it takes seven hours to explain what should be understood in seven minutes. Is there a ticketing system out there that not only lets you write a clear specification but also forces the recipient to read the spec?<p>One developer I know has theorized it&#x27;s because of how they teach math in $country.
