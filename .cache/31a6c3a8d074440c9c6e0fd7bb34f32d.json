awareness about something that many Steam users (myself included) didn't know about \u2014 until it was too late:\n\n\n---\n\nThe Steam Web API Key scam.\n\nThis is a legitimate feature created by Steam for developers to interact with your inventory.\nBut if you're not careful, a malicious site or extension can silently activate it on your account without your knowledge \u2014 and then use it to scam you.\n\n\n---\n\nHow does the scam work?\n\nYou get tricked into logging into a fake or compromised site.\n\nThe attacker activates an API Key on your account (usually with the domain localhost).\n\nThis key allows them to intercept your trade offers, cancel them, and resend a copy of the same offer to a fake lookalike account.\n\nThe trade looks normal, you confirm it, and your item is gone.\n\n\n\n---\n\nHow to check if you're safe:\n\nGo to this link:\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey\n\nIf you see a key activated with any domain (especially localhost),\nClick: \"Revoke My Steam Web API Key\" immediately.\n\nIf it says:\n\n&gt; You do not have a Steam Web API Key\nYou're safe (for now).\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n\nTips to protect yourself:\n\nNever trade through the browser. Use the Steam app or official client.\n\nDon't click on trade links from unknown users.\n\nAlways double-check names, levels, and profile URLs.\n\nEnable Steam Guard and change your password regularly.\n\n\n\n---\n\nI lost valuable skins to this method, and Steam support hasn't recovered anything so far.\nBut if I can help someone avoid this trap, it\u2019s worth it.\n\nPlease share and stay safe out there.", "author_fullname": "t2_a8x6vwh3", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Warning to all Steam users: API Key scam can cost you your entire inventory \u2014 even if you're careful!", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "PSA"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Steam", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "psa", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_1kuog7m", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3460, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "PSA", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 3460, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "post_hint": "self", "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1748128280.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.Steam", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just wanted to raise awareness about something that many Steam users (myself included) didn&amp;#39;t know about \u2014 until it was too late:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Steam Web API Key scam.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is a legitimate feature created by Steam for developers to interact with your inventory.\nBut if you&amp;#39;re not careful, a malicious site or extension can silently activate it on your account without your knowledge \u2014 and then use it to scam you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How does the scam work?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You get tricked into logging into a fake or compromised site.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The attacker activates an API Key on your account (usually with the domain localhost).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This key allows them to intercept your trade offers, cancel them, and resend a copy of the same offer to a fake lookalike account.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The trade looks normal, you confirm it, and your item is gone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How to check if you&amp;#39;re safe:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Go to this link:\n&lt;a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey\"&gt;https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you see a key activated with any domain (especially localhost),\nClick: &amp;quot;Revoke My Steam Web API Key&amp;quot; immediately.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If it says:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You do not have a Steam Web API Key\nYou&amp;#39;re safe (for now).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tips to protect yourself:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Never trade through the browser.
