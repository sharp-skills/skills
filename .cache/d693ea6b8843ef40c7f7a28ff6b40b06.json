On the tech side, Enso is a visual and textual programming language (you can switch from graph to code and back). On the business side, it's a workflow builder that makes it easy for analysts without a programming background to automate data-driven processes simply by connecting visual components together. Our GUI is like an IDE, but with a graph editor alongside the code. Currently, we\u2019re focused on data analysis\u2014data preparation, blending, and analytics (both in-memory and SQL). You can see a video of how it works here: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/fQvWMoOjmQk\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://youtu.be/fQvWMoOjmQk</a>.<p>We used to be called Luna and were lucky to have a few big threads on HN over the years [1][2][3][4][5]. Eventually we went into heads-down mode to make a <em>production</em> version based on customer and user feedback. Since then, we've drastically improved the product. It is still rough around the edges, but works much better now. We have also made a few tutorials (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4oMK7cL1ElfNR_OhS-YQAw\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4oMK7cL1ElfNR_OhS-YQAw</a>), and\ndocs (<a href=\"https://enso.org/docs/syntax\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://enso.org/docs/syntax</a>). We've added many new libraries, so you can do many more things with it now. Oh, and we changed the name to Enso and got accepted to YC! :)<p>The problem we address is that data analysts still waste up to half of their time on repetitive manual work that can be automated [6]. To give one example, a company we're working with hires business users who use <em>Excel</em> to define data quality rules. These get manually translated to SQL, then manually translated to Python. This is not only error prone, it\u2019s so slow that it takes them 90 days to introduce a single new rule. There\u2019s 60 days\u2019 worth of overhead in this process\u2014it\u2019s insane!<p>Years ago I (Wojciech) led the in-house development of visual effects (VFX) tools at a motion picture studio. We made tools like cloud renderers and smoke simulation engines. The artists using these tools did not have any programming background, yet they were designing complex algorithms for forces between particles, light subsurface scattering, things like that. Earlier generations of these tools had hundreds of config options, buttons, etc., for masses of different use cases, but this approach got way too complex and people eventually realized that it falls short when you need to do anything that the vendor did not think of. Nowadays they use node-based software (like the Houdini FX) which lets users draw algorithms as a sequence of data processing steps (these steps are often referred to as \u201cnodes\u201d). Later, when I was working in other industries and encountered the same rats\u2019 nests of complex GUIs for solving data processing problems, I realized that the data analytics/science space was in need of the same breakthrough that we had already gone through in the VFX space.<p>Most visual programming languages / workflow-builders do not scale well because they don't let users express abstractions. Try to build a complex pipeline and you'll end with an unreadable spaghetti of connections\u2014it's like coding a web app in assembler. Enso is different because we allow you to build abstractions to manage the complexity. As a result, you never have more than 10-20 nodes on the stage in Enso (nodes are hierarchical). You can create custom data types, custom components (functions), catch errors, etc. All this works because under the hood, Enso is a real programming language. However, naive implementations of such systems are super slow. Each component may be built of hundreds, sometimes thousands of lower-level ones. The real trick is making these hierarchical components run fast. For that you need a dedicated compiler and a runtime system, and this is a hard technical space. Our system involves a dedicated JIT compiler based on GraalVM. For details, see <a href=\"https://enso.org/language#compiler\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://enso.org/language#compiler</a>. In case this is interesting for you, here is our podcast about how the compiler works under the hood: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BibjcUjdkO4\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BibjcUjdkO4</a>.<p>Enso is interactive, meaning that we recompute the relevant parts of graphs as parameters change, which shortens feedback loops dramatically. Like a lot of people on HN, we were inspired by Bret Victor's classic talk on instant feedback: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QiPFmIMxFc\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QiPFmIMxFc</a>.  We\u2019ve also put a lot of effort into extensibility. You can add Java, JavaScript, R, and Python (soon also Ruby, Scala, Kotlin, Rust, and C) directly into Enso nodes without the need to write any wrappers and with a close-to-zero performance overhead.<p>Enso is open source.

Our business model is based on selling domain specific libraries, on-premise installations with enhanced user permission management, and coming soon, a hosted solution called Enso Cloud, which will be our only non-open-source codebase. Since this is Hacker News, I should add that all our alpha releases collect anonymous usage statistics which we use to improve Enso and prepare it for a stable release.

Since this is Hacker News, I should add that all our alpha releases collect anonymous usage statistics which we use to improve Enso and prepare it for a stable release.

Please, share with us your thoughts, experiences, ideas and feedback. It is insanely important to us, as our dream is to make Enso the most useful data processing platform in your toolbox! Also, in case you\u2019d like to build your projects on top of Enso, we would love to help you do it \u2013 describe what you have in mind here, and we will reach out to you: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;airtable.com&#x2F;shrsnx2mJuRn0MxIS\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;airtable.com&#x2F;shrsnx2mJuRn0MxIS</a> :)<p>=== Links ===<p>[1] <i>Luna: Visual and textual functional programming language</i> - <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=11144828\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=11144828</a> - Feb 2016 (100 comments)<p>[2] <i>Luna \u2013 Visual and textual functional programming language</i> - <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=14612680\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=14612680</a> - June 2017 (310 comments)<p>[3] <i>Luna 1.0 Beta is out</i> - <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=16163769\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=16163769</a> - Jan 2018 (167 comments)<p>[4] <i>Luna Studio \u2013 Visual and textual functional programming language</i> - <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=17704989\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=17704989</a> - Aug 2018 (64 comments)<p>[5] <i>Luna \u2013 A WYSIWYG language for data processing</i> - <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=20182090\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=20182090</a> - June 2019 (86 comments)<p>[6] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.alteryx.com&#x2F;e-book&#x2F;idc-study-the-state-of-self-service-data-preparation-and-analysis-using-spreadsheets\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.alteryx.com&#x2F;e-book&#x2F;idc-study-the-state-of-self-s...</a>", "title": "Launch HN: Enso (YC S21) \u2013 Visual programming and workflow automation tool", "updated_at": "2024-09-29T17:47:50Z"}, {"_highlightResult": {"author": {"matchLevel": "none", "matchedWords": [], "value": "adam_carrigan"}, "story_text": {"fullyHighlighted": false, "matchLevel": "full", "matchedWords": ["exceljs", "production"], "value": "Hi HN,<p>Adam and Jorge here,  and today we\u2019re very excited to share MindsDB with you (<a href=\"http://github.com/mindsdb/mindsdb\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://github.com/mindsdb/mindsdb</a>).

Off-shore teams are often unreliable and costlier than software, plus they\u2019re not always an option for regulated industries.<p>I previously built RPA scripts impacting 20K+ employees at a Fortune 100 company where I experienced first hand RPA\u2019s brittleness and inflexibility.

The agent then leverages computer use AI models to learn the steps and memorizes them by saving each screenshot alongside its action (click on these coordinates, type XYZ, wait for page to load, etc).<p>The agent deterministically runs through these steps to run fast and predictably. In order to account for popups and UI changes, our agent checks the live screen state against the memorized state to determine whether it\u2019s safe to proceed with the memorized step. If no major changes prevent safe execution of the memorized step, it proceeds; otherwise, it falls back to a computer use model with context on past actions and the remaining task.<p>Customers are currently using us for manual tasks like importing and exporting files from legacy desktop applications, booking appointments for patients on a desktop PMS, and data entry for filling our forms like patient profiles and such in an EMR.<p>We don't have a self-serve option yet but we'd love to onboard you manually.
