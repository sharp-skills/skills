The change has a permanent URL so you can look it up later if you forgot what you did, use it to help you move settings from staging to prod, or have others review the changes that were made. Now that Gold Fig has captured what changed, when, and why, you\u2019ll never get stuck in a situation where only one person knows exactly how something was configured.  A byproduct of Gold Fig is that you now have a foothold into being able to undo these types of changes. We envision Gold Fig being part of all devops team\u2019s way of surfacing and tracking changes.

Everything was either expensive, too generic, or both. The workflows for a small-batch manufacturer aren\u2019t that complex, but the pricing acts like they are.<p>So I built Craftplan. All the features were tailored to what she actually needed, and I figured other small-scale manufacturers (soap makers, breweries, candle makers, etc.) probably need the same things. So I\u2019m putting it out there for free.<p><pre><code>  - Live demo: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;craftplan.fly.dev (test@test.com &#x2F; Aa123123123123)\n  - GitHub: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;puemos&#x2F;craftplan\n  - Docs: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;puemos.github.io&#x2F;craftplan\n  - Self-hosting guide: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;puemos.github.io&#x2F;craftplan&#x2F;docs&#x2F;self-hosting&#x2F;\n</code></pre>\nWhat it does:<p><pre><code>  - Product catalog with versioned recipes (BOMs) and automatic cost rollups across materials, labor, and overhead\n  - Inventory tracking with lot traceability, expiry dates, allergen&#x2F;nutrition flags, and demand forecasting\n  - Order processing with calendar-based scheduling and allocation to production batches\n  - Production planner with make sheets, material consumption from specific lots, and cost snapshots\n  - Purchase orders with receiving workflow that auto-creates inventory lots\n  - Basic CRM for customers and suppliers\n  - CSV import&#x2F;export, iCal calendar feed, JSON:API and GraphQL endpoints\n</code></pre>\nExperience building with Elixir, Ash and Liveview:<p><pre><code>  - Speed: you get to test and improve things sooo fast. The DSL makes it simple to translate your thinking into live product\n  - Extensibility: With Ash + LiveView you can add more features so easily. Adding JSON:API + Grapghql was a few minutes.\n  - UX: I believe LiveView makes it simple to deliver great UX since it forcing you to keep things simple with no so much interaction overhead which most of the time means better and simple experience\n</code></pre>\nSelf-hosting:<p><pre><code>  - Docker image: `ghcr.io&#x2F;puemos&#x2F;craftplan` (amd64 + arm64)\n  - Docker Compose bundles PostgreSQL 16 + MinIO.\n\n</code></pre>\nOther details:<p><pre><code>  - Email config from UI (SMTP, SendGrid, Mailgun, Postmark, Brevo, Amazon SES)\n  - API keys encrypted at rest (AES-256-GCM)\n  - Role-based access (admin&#x2F;staff)\n  - Tech stack: Elixir, Ash Framework, Phoenix LiveView, PostgreSQL\n  - License: AGPLv3\n\n</code></pre>\nFeedback welcome (and needed!)", "title": "Show HN: Craftplan \u2013 Elixir-based micro-ERP for small-scale manufacturers", "updated_at": "2026-02-12T07:14:30Z", "url": "https://puemos.github.io/craftplan/"}, {"_highlightResult": {"author": {"matchLevel": "none", "matchedWords": [], "value": "reinhardt"}, "story_text": {"fullyHighlighted": false, "matchLevel": "full", "matchedWords": ["sendgrid", "production"], "value": "At work we maintain passwords, keys and secrets for a few dozens internal and 3rd party services such as S3, <em>Sendgrid</em>, Xero and more.
