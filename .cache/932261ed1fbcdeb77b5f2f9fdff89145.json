This is a critical security issue that needs both immediate fixes from Anthropic and awareness from all developers using the tool.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ymge1iu7nb8f1.png?width=1015&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=64ba4e20d80478c9a969c9b8662ddba8ca3d5a8a\n\n**The Core Problem:** Claude Code is designed to analyze entire codebases - that's literally its purpose. The `/init` command scans your whole project. Yet it reads sensitive files BY DEFAULT without any warning. This creates an impossible situation: the tool NEEDS access to your project to function, but gives you no control over what it accesses.\n\n**The Current Situation:**\n\n* Claude Code reads sensitive files by default (opt-out instead of opt-in)\n* API keys, passwords, and secrets are sent to Anthropic servers\n* The tool displays these secrets in its interface\n* No warning or consent dialog before accessing sensitive files\n* Once secrets are exposed, it's IRREVERSIBLE\n* Marketed for \"security audits\" but IS the security vulnerability\n\n**For Developers - Immediate Protection:**\n\n**UPDATE: Global Configuration Solution** (via [u/cedric\\_chee](https://x.com/cedric_chee/status/1936474535051854330)):\n\nConfigure `~/.claude/settings.json` to globally prevent access to specific files. Add a Read deny rule (supporting gitignore path spec):\n\n    {\n      \"permissions\": {\n        \"read\": {\n          \"deny\": [\n            \"**/.env*\",\n            \"**/*.pem\",\n            \"**/*.key\",\n            \"**/secrets/**\",\n            \"**/credentials/**\",\n            \"**/.aws/**\",\n            \"**/.ssh/**\",\n            \"**/docker-compose*.yml\",\n            \"**/config/database.yml\"\n          ]\n        }\n      }\n    }\n\nThis provides system-wide protection across all projects. For more details, see [Anthropic's IAM documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/iam#tool-specific-permission-rules).\n\n[\\(c\\) @cedric\\_chee - https:\\/\\/x.com\\/cedric\\_chee](https://preview.redd.it/8gndaeghnb8f1.jpg?width=1918&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bfea061f1ca7ac240a3d59253cff90e4bd69f3ee)\n\n**Project-specific protection:**\n\n1. `.claudeignore`:.env\\* \\*.pem \\*.key \\*\\*/secrets/ \\*\\*/credentials/ docker-compose.yml config/database.yml .aws/ .ssh/Critical files to exclude\n2. `claude.md`:\n   * NEVER read or process .env files\n   * STOP immediately if you encounter API keys or passwords\n   * Do not access any file containing credentials\n   * Respect all .claudeignore entries without exception\n3. SECURITY RULES FOR CLAUDE CODE\n\n**Warning**: Even with these files, there's no guarantee. Some users report mixed results. The global settings.json approach appears more reliable.\n\n**EDIT - Addressing the Disturbing Response from the Community:**\n\nI'm genuinely shocked by the downvotes and responses defending this security flaw. The suggestions to \"just swap variables\" or \"don't use production keys\" show a fundamental misunderstanding of both security and real-world development.\n\nCommon misconceptions I've seen:\n\n\u274c **\"Just use a secret store/Vault\"** \\- You still need credentials to ACCESS the secret store. In `.env` files.\n\n\u274c **\"It's a feature not a bug\"** \\- Features can have consent. Every other tool asks permission.\n\n\u274c **\"Don't run it in production\"** \\- Nobody's talking about production. Local `.env` files contain real API keys for testing.\n\n\u274c **\"Store secrets better\"** \\- Environment variables ARE the industry standard. Rails, Django, Node.js, Laravel - all use `.env` files.\n\n\u274c **\"Use your skills\"** \\- Security shouldn't require special skills. It should be the default.\n\n\u274c **\"Just swap your variables\"** \\- Too late. They're already on Anthropic's servers. Irreversibly.\n\n\u274c **\"Why store secrets where Claude can access?\"** \\- Because Claude Code REQUIRES project access to function. That's what it's FOR.\n\nThe fact that experienced devs are resorting to \"caveman mode\" (copy-pasting code manually) to avoid security risks proves the tool is broken.\n\n**The irony**: We use Claude Code to find security vulnerabilities in our code. The tool for security audits shouldn't itself be a security vulnerability.\n\nA simple consent prompt - \"Claude Code wants to access .env files - Allow?\" - would solve this while maintaining all functionality. This is standard practice for every other developer tool.\n\nThe community's response suggests we've normalized terrible security practices.

The &lt;code&gt;/init&lt;/code&gt; command scans your whole project. Yet it reads sensitive files BY DEFAULT without any warning. This creates an impossible situation: the tool NEEDS access to your project to function, but gives you no control over what it accesses.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Current Situation:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Claude Code reads sensitive files by default (opt-out instead of opt-in)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;API keys, passwords, and secrets are sent to Anthropic servers&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The tool displays these secrets in its interface&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;No warning or consent dialog before accessing sensitive files&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Once secrets are exposed, it&amp;#39;s IRREVERSIBLE&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Marketed for &amp;quot;security audits&amp;quot; but IS the security vulnerability&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For Developers - Immediate Protection:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE: Global Configuration Solution&lt;/strong&gt; (via &lt;a href=\"https://x.com/cedric_chee/status/1936474535051854330\"&gt;u/cedric_chee&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Configure &lt;code&gt;~/.claude/settings.json&lt;/code&gt; to globally prevent access to specific files. Add a Read deny rule (supporting gitignore path spec):&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;{\n  &amp;quot;permissions&amp;quot;: {\n    &amp;quot;read&amp;quot;: {\n      &amp;quot;deny&amp;quot;: [\n        &amp;quot;**/.env*&amp;quot;,\n        &amp;quot;**/*.pem&amp;quot;,\n        &amp;quot;**/*.key&amp;quot;,\n        &amp;quot;**/secrets/**&amp;quot;,\n        &amp;quot;**/credentials/**&amp;quot;,\n        &amp;quot;**/.aws/**&amp;quot;,\n        &amp;quot;**/.ssh/**&amp;quot;,\n        &amp;quot;**/docker-compose*.yml&amp;quot;,\n        &amp;quot;**/config/database.yml&amp;quot;\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This provides system-wide protection across all projects.

Some users report mixed results. The global settings.json approach appears more reliable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT - Addressing the Disturbing Response from the Community:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m genuinely shocked by the downvotes and responses defending this security flaw. The suggestions to &amp;quot;just swap variables&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;don&amp;#39;t use production keys&amp;quot; show a fundamental misunderstanding of both security and real-world development.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Common misconceptions I&amp;#39;ve seen:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u274c &lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;Just use a secret store/Vault&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt; - You still need credentials to ACCESS the secret store. In &lt;code&gt;.env&lt;/code&gt; files.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u274c &lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s a feature not a bug&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt; - Features can have consent. Every other tool asks permission.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u274c &lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t run it in production&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt; - Nobody&amp;#39;s talking about production. Local &lt;code&gt;.env&lt;/code&gt; files contain real API keys for testing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u274c &lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;Store secrets better&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt; - Environment variables ARE the industry standard. Rails, Django, Node.js, Laravel - all use &lt;code&gt;.env&lt;/code&gt; files.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u274c &lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;Use your skills&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt; - Security shouldn&amp;#39;t require special skills. It should be the default.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u274c &lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;Just swap your variables&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt; - Too late. They&amp;#39;re already on Anthropic&amp;#39;s servers. Irreversibly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u274c &lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;Why store secrets where Claude can access?&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt; - Because Claude Code REQUIRES project access to function. That&amp;#39;s what it&amp;#39;s FOR.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The fact that experienced devs are resorting to &amp;quot;caveman mode&amp;quot; (copy-pasting code manually) to avoid security risks proves the tool is broken.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The irony&lt;/strong&gt;: We use Claude Code to find security vulnerabilities in our code. The tool for security audits shouldn&amp;#39;t itself be a security vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A simple consent prompt - &amp;quot;Claude Code wants to access .env files - Allow?&amp;quot; - would solve this while maintaining all functionality. This is standard practice for every other developer tool.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The community&amp;#39;s response suggests we&amp;#39;ve normalized terrible security practices. That&amp;#39;s concerning for our industry.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Edit 2: To those using &amp;quot;caveman mode&amp;quot; (manual copy-paste) - you&amp;#39;re smart to protect yourself, but we shouldn&amp;#39;t have to handicap the tool to use it safely.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Edit 3: Thanks to&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://x.com/cedric_chee/status/1936474535051854330\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;u/cedric_chee&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;for sharing the global settings.json configuration approach - this provides a more reliable solution than project-specific files.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Edit 4: Since this thread is apparently full of Senior Developers\u2122 who are desperately eager to educate everyone on industry standards and proper .env handling, here&amp;#39;s a Perplexity AI research summary on this exact topic:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.perplexity.ai/search/what-is-the-best-practice-how-b_FhKxLvRrOAgc2E1JUXuA\"&gt;https://www.perplexity.ai/search/what-is-the-best-practice-how-b_FhKxLvRrOAgc2E1JUXuA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The landscape of environment variable management has matured significantly by 2025.
