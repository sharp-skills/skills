Each species is composed of modular \u201corgans\u201d (signal processors, risk controllers, execution logic, etc.), and mutations are constrained to compatible <em>organ</em> classes so components can recombine safely. Survival is determined by real-world performance under nonstationary environments rather than offline benchmarks.\nInstead of using LLMs to directly generate actions, I\u2019m using them as an environment interpreter.
