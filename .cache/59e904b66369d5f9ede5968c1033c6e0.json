Context\n\n'Tea' is an app that promotes itself as a tool for dating safety. In this platform, women are able to discuss their experiences dating men anonymously, with the ability to search specific man by name and identify potential red flags, criminal history or just do a general background check. It can be seen as an evolution of \"are we dating the same guy?\" facebook groups. To verify the identity of its users, they're asked to upload an ID and a selfie. The ID requirement was removed after 2023, according to app developers. It has recently gone viral, and due to its very nature it is extremely controversial.\n\nFirst reported by [404 Media](https://archive.is/y7J9Z), there was a data breach where thousands of photos and IDs of the app users were \"leaked\" to 4chan. However, there was no hacking involved, because the database was stored publicly, without any kind of encryption. Here's a [statement by the app developers](https://www.teaforwomen.com/cyberincident).\n\n# Reactions\n\nWhile some redditors worry about the privacy and safety of the women whose data was leaked, some others see it as karmic justice, considering the app itself as a tool for doxing men. Some others just see it as a badly developed app based on mostly \"vibe coding\". Fair warning, comments get pretty ugly, misoginistic and racist, so this migth not be everyone's cup of tea (ha!). Here's some selected popcorn:\n\n* [Is it karma?](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1m927j6/comment/n53w7z0/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n&gt;The doxxers become the doxxed, if karma exists this might be the clearest example.\n\n* For some reason, [discussion gets racial](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1m927j6/comment/n53u6cz/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button) (xenophobic might be a better word)\n\n&gt;You are a complete idiot if you upload your drivers license to services like this. The app uploaded all user verification submissions to a public firebase storage bucket with the prefix \"attachments\u201d This is what happens when you entrust your personal information to a bunch of vibe-coders and H1B hires. This wasn\u2019t a \u201chack\u201d, the database wasn\u2019t even encrypted to begin with. They're going to get absolutely slammed with lawsuits over this. Someone already made a map that ties the user ID to a GPS location.\n\n&gt;H1B hires feels weird, no?\n\n* [App user is worried her data may had leaked](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1m927j6/comment/n558rg9/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n&gt;Sad to say I signed up for the app 3 days ago and am scared my data has been breached. Dating in NYC sucks and I really liked the concept of knowing of potentially dangerous or toxic men before I waste my time. :/\n\n&gt;You're aware that dangerous or toxic women could put men's details on this app, purely out of malice ... right ?\n\n* Was the app really about dating safety, or [just an excuse for doxing?](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1m927j6/comment/n53xvbe/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n&gt;I have a real issue with the description of this app. This isn\u2019t a \u201cDating Safety\u201d app it\u2019s a way for women to share images and reviews of men they\u2019ve dated without their consent. So basically couldn\u2019t happen to a nicer group of people.\n\n&gt;Dating Safety is a large part of it. I was on it for a bit and it was all \u201cthis guy beat me, this guys on all the dating apps and he\u2019s a registered sex offender, this guy assaulted me.\u201d Like feel how you want about the app but that was certainly a major feature/use of it.\n\n* A redditor is [very happy about the breach.](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1m927j6/comment/n540z5d/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button) Somehow, things get racial (xenophobic) AGAIN\n\n&gt;Good. These women are okay with breaching men's privacy and doxing them. I have absolutely zero sympathy for these scum.\n\n&gt;The number of men who think women finding avenues for communication to help each other make better informed choices around dating is wild. This is why the Saudi Arabian government made it illegal for women to talk to each other.  Because men don\u2019t want women commiserating their experiences and realizing they are being oppressed/mistreated.\n\n* [Fake accussations are brought up](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1m927j6/comment/n54av7h/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n&gt;What happens if a woman posts lies about a man?\n\n&gt;Whoa there pal, cool it with the misogyny. We all know women are wonderful and never do anything underhanded\n\n* [Age verification is discussed](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1m927j6/comment/n53q8if/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n&gt;And so the breaches everyone pointed out where the inevitable outcome of the Age Verification stupidity, has started\n\n&gt;Honestly Age Verification is an IQ test when VPNs exist.\n\nThere's a lot of discussion, so feel free to check the comments in the post.

Dating in NYC sucks and I really liked the concept of knowing of potentially dangerous or toxic men before I waste my time. :/&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re aware that dangerous or toxic women could put men&amp;#39;s details on this app, purely out of malice ... right ?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Was the app really about dating safety, or &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1m927j6/comment/n53xvbe/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;amp;utm_term=1&amp;amp;utm_content=share_button\"&gt;just an excuse for doxing?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I have a real issue with the description of this app. This isn\u2019t a \u201cDating Safety\u201d app it\u2019s a way for women to share images and reviews of men they\u2019ve dated without their consent. So basically couldn\u2019t happen to a nicer group of people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dating Safety is a large part of it. I was on it for a bit and it was all \u201cthis guy beat me, this guys on all the dating apps and he\u2019s a registered sex offender, this guy assaulted me.\u201d Like feel how you want about the app but that was certainly a major feature/use of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;A redditor is &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1m927j6/comment/n540z5d/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;amp;utm_term=1&amp;amp;utm_content=share_button\"&gt;very happy about the breach.&lt;/a&gt; Somehow, things get racial (xenophobic) AGAIN&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Good. These women are okay with breaching men&amp;#39;s privacy and doxing them. I have absolutely zero sympathy for these scum.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The number of men who think women finding avenues for communication to help each other make better informed choices around dating is wild. This is why the Saudi Arabian government made it illegal for women to talk to each other.  Because men don\u2019t want women commiserating their experiences and realizing they are being oppressed/mistreated.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1m927j6/comment/n54av7h/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;amp;utm_term=1&amp;amp;utm_content=share_button\"&gt;Fake accussations are brought up&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;What happens if a woman posts lies about a man?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Whoa there pal, cool it with the misogyny. We all know women are wonderful and never do anything underhanded&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1m927j6/comment/n53q8if/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;amp;utm_term=1&amp;amp;utm_content=share_button\"&gt;Age verification is discussed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;And so the breaches everyone pointed out where the inevitable outcome of the Age Verification stupidity, has started&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Honestly Age Verification is an IQ test when VPNs exist.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a lot of discussion, so feel free to check the comments in the post.
