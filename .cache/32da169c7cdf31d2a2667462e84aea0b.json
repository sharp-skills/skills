We decided to let our service/support contract expire this year after we found out it jumped from $43k to $99k. We have perpetual licenses so there's not much concern in the department about things breaking. We are already in the process of migrating to AWS (we already have a large AWS presence) and Hyper-V. We're also evaluating Proxmox as a potential replacement for Hyper-V as well but that's a 2026-2027 initiative.\n\n**Today's Communication:**  \nOur license expires on (Dec 31st, 2025). Our VMware rep was already being pushy but today it escalated when the rep sent this email:\n\n&gt;Your licenses expire today and you will face environment disruptions\u00a0as well as penalty fees if a PO is not submitted today.

My understanding is that while our SnS (Support and Subscription) may be ending, the software itself will continue to function **AS LICENSED**.\n\n&gt;Has the legal definition for perpetual changed recently?\n\n&gt;Regards\n\n# UPDATE 1:\n\nJust received another notice from our VAR &amp; Broadcom:\n\n&gt;Providing an update regarding your VMware subscription in hopes that this allows your team to make a confident decision with this renewal. I have informed your Broadcom representative, &lt;name of rep redacted&gt;, that &lt;name of company&gt; does not plan to renew its VMware subscription. It's come to my knowledge that Broadcom has recently implemented cancellation policy requiring customers to uninstall their current licenses which will result in a loss of connection between your vSphere and vCenter, bringing down your environment. If your team decides that letting the subscription lapse is still the best course of action, the attached \u201cSoftware, Certificate of Destruction\u201d will need to be signed and returned asap.\n\nIt contains an attachment called \"Software, Certification of Destruction.pdf\". Here's the contents of said attachment:\n\n&gt;**Certification Regarding Use of Subscription Software**\n\n&gt;Customer acknowledges that the subscription term for Subscription Software acquired under the Order referenced in the above letter has expired, and therefore Customer must cease its use of such Subscription Software and deinstall the Subscription Software licenses. Customer further acknowledges that continued use of the Subscription Software beyond the Term Expiration Date is a material breach of the Order and the governing contracts between Customer and Broadcom (the \u201cAgreements\u201d) and an infringement of Broadcom\u2019s intellectual property rights, potentially resulting in claims for enhanced damages and attorney\u2019s fees.\n\n&gt;By signing this certification, Customer certifies that it has discontinued all use of the Subscription Software and has deinstalled the licenses.\n\n&gt;Broadcom reserves all rights it may have with respect to this subject matter.\n\n&gt;Printed Name of Authorized Signatory of Customer:\n\n&gt;Signature of Authorized Signatory of Customer:\n\n&gt;Title of Signatory:\n\n&gt;Date:\n\n# UPDATE 2 (resolution):\n\nAfter reviewing with our VAR we figured out what happened. Apparently in our last renewal VMware pulled the rug out from under us and swapped out the SKU to one that corresponded to a subscription. And by signing the renewal last year, VMware says we forfeited our perpetual license and therefore have only two options, pay now or remove VMware from our environment immediately. While I would prefer the latter option, that's not viable on such short notice (1 day). Our VAR went back to VMware, explained the situation and how they pulled the rug on us and that there would likely be legal involvement, at which point VMware countered with around $30k less than the original quote.
