{"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "Btechtards", "selftext": "Hello everyone. I am the guy who got the 1 lakh rupees monthly stipend. Many of you asked me to share my journey, my preparation, and the whole process.\n\nFirst, I am really sorry for not replying to DMs or comments. My inbox had more than 300 messages and the post had around 650 comments. I couldn\u2019t reply to everyone. But thank you to all of you. I am genuinely happy if my story inspired even a few people.  \nSome people thought the post was fake or karma farming. I don\u2019t know how to prove anything, so I will just share my journey here.\n\nHere is the link to my previous post: [*https://www.reddit.com/r/Btechtards/s/zBUfBckd85*](https://www.reddit.com/r/Btechtards/s/zBUfBckd85)\n\n# My Background\n\nAs I mentioned before, I am from a lower middle class family in a tier 2 city in South India. I was doing well in studies until 10th grade. My family believed in me so much that they even took EMI to get me online coaching for JEE.\n\nBut I don\u2019t know what happened during 11th and 12th. I suddenly lost interest in studying. I didn\u2019t prepare properly for JEE and my board exams. I somehow got 80 percent in boards and 49 percentile in JEE Mains.  \nBecause of that, I joined a tier 3 college in my city in the CSE department (2026 batch).\n\nAfter the results, I regretted it a lot. I felt guilty for wasting my family\u2019s money. I knew that if I had prepared properly for 1 or 2 attempts, I could have cracked JEE. But I didn\u2019t do it.\n\nSo when I joined college, I made a promise to myself. Either crack into an IIT or NIT for post graduation or compete and win in the real world even without those tags.\n\n# College Journey\n\nIn the first year, I discovered LinkedIn. Our institution forced everyone to post at least once a month. Most students ignored it or posted random copy-pasted content from ChatGPT.\n\nBut I understood that LinkedIn could be useful. So I spent a lot of time building my profile, doing certifications, and working on projects in AI, cloud, and development.\n\n# My First Internship\n\nAt the end of my second year, I got an internship at a startup because of my projects. It was a Generative AI Engineering role. I learned a lot about building AI-based applications.\n\nThe experience was not great overall, but it helped me explore the field.\n\nIn my third year (6th semester), I resigned and decided to focus on DSA and placements.\n\n# My DSA Struggle\n\nHonestly, DSA was very tough for me in the beginning. I couldn\u2019t solve even a single problem on LeetCode. **Using GPT and Claude heavily during my internship had made me depend too much on them.**\n\nSo I started from the basics. I solved easy problems on HackerRank first and slowly moved to LeetCode. I eventually got 5-star gold badges in both Python and Java on HackerRank.  \nI have solved a little more than 200 problems on LeetCode till now. Yes, it is low.\n\nBut here is the truth.\n\n&gt; *Only doing DSA will not help you much.*\n\n  \nI know many people in my college who solved way more problems, but they cannot even build simple things like authentication for an application.\n\n# Why My Profile Stood Out\n\n* I was good at development. I built projects that solved real problems. They were not huge or fancy, but they had purpose. This gave me a lot of attention during interviews and also on LinkedIn.\n* In 2025, I had more than 860 GitHub contributions from personal learning and freelancing projects. I did AI-assisted coding, but I understood the fundamentals. I always stayed updated in the tech I was interested in.\n* I can see there are lot comments to share my profile links, but I can't share my profiles due to privacy concerns.\n\n# The Dark Phases\n\nI have gone through a lot of dark phases. *Losing interest, feeling empty, burnout, confusion, and a lot more.*\n\nBut I always tried to maintain at least a little consistency in something.\n\nI faced a lot of rejections. Many companies didn\u2019t shortlist me. Some ghosted me.  \n\n\n# Campus Placements:\n\nDuring campus placements, I got a 4 LPA offer from a WITCH company in October 2025. It felt good, but I wasn\u2019t satisfied. I knew I could do better.\n\nSo I kept applying for bigger companies and good startups.\n\n# How I Applied:\n\nI used a Notion Kanban board to track my applications. There are multiple templates, you can use whatever you like.  \nlink:  [https://www.notion.com/templates/category/job-application-tracking](https://www.notion.com/templates/category/job-application-tracking)   \nThis helped me a lot. It showed me progress even when I felt I wasn\u2019t moving forward.  \nIt also helped me understand which type of roles were responding and which ones weren\u2019t.\n\nI made my resume using Overleaf. There are many good templates online. Just avoid multi-column layouts because some ATS systems do not parse them well. **You don\u2019t need a \u201cperfect score\u201d resume analyzer.** Use GPT or Gemini to fix grammar and formatting and you are good to go.\n\n# The Turning Point: December 2025\n\nDecember was the month that changed everything.\n\nI got a 7 LPA offer from a cybersecurity startup for the AI engineer role. On the same day, I got a call from a big US-based company for a role I had applied for a month before.\n\nWhen the HR told me the stipend was 1 lakh per month, I was shocked. It was 10 times my previous stipend (10k) and 20 times my first stipend (5k). And they had only one intern position in the team.\n\nI decided to give my best without thinking too much about the result, since i had two offers in hand for the backup instead of pressurizing myself.\n\n# Round 1:\n\nThe interview happened for around 1 hour and had questions from:\n\n* my resume\n* my projects\n* backend concepts like authentication ,DBMS, etc.\n* some cloud related questions\n* DSA in the last 20-30 minutes\n\nThe interviewer was kind and supportive. I got the next round invite that evening. I was happy that i made it till this far. My confidence was also increased but i didn't pressurized myself again.\n\n# Round 2\n\nThis round was with a senior manager. He asked about  my projects, system design and lot of fundamentals again. At the end, he even told me I needed to learn some concepts better. So I thought I was rejected.\n\nI had other interviews that day, so I continued preparing for them. I dint worried about this interview and I was genuinely happy to make progress this far.\n\n# The Result\n\nNext morning, I woke up and saw an email from them. I thought it was a rejection mail as usual.\n\nBut it said ***\u201cCONGRATULATIONS, we have an internship\u00a0to extend!\u201d***\n\n*I was half asleep and couldn\u2019t believe it. I literally thought I was dreaming.*\n\nMy family was extremely happy so were my grandparents and my uncle, who supported me right from the start.\n\n\n\n# The Roadmap I would suggest\n\nThis is the roadmap that worked for me.  \nNot perfect, but simple and practical. There is no need to follow this exactly, you can customize as per your wish since this **your path** \n\n**1. Build Fundamentals First**\n\n* Python or Java basics\n* OOP\n* Basic data structures\n* Databases (SQL, joins, indexes)\n* Basic computer networks\n\nNothing fancy. Just enough to understand systems.\n\n**2. Start With Development**\n\nI picked small, real-life problems and built projects around them. Example:\n\n* authentication system\n* simple API backend\n* small AI tools\n* automation scripts\n* mini cloud-based projects\n\nProjects gave me confidence when DSA didn\u2019t.\n\n**3. Slowly Add DSA**\n\nI followed this sequence:\n\n* HackerRank easy problems\n* LeetCode easy\n* HackeRank medium\n* LeetCode medium\n* Tried to solve 1\u20132 problems everyday\n\n**4. Build a Strong Online Presence**\n\nI focused on:\n\n* LinkedIn profile\n* GitHub activity\n* Clean README in every project\n* Posting summaries of what I learned\n\n**5. Resume + Portfolio**\n\n* Overleaf single-column template\n* Quantified achievements\n* Clean GitHub profile page\n* Good looking portfolio page\n\n**6. Apply Consistently**\n\nI applied through:\n\n* LinkedIn\n* Glassdoor\n* Indeed\n* Internshala\n* Company career pages\n* Referrals when possible\n\nI tracked everything using:\n\n* Notion job application tracker\n\n**7. Prepare for Interviews**\n\nI revised:\n\n* Basics of backend\n* DBMS\n* System design fundamentals\n* Cloud basics\n* My own projects deeply\n\n**8. Stay Consistent**\n\nEven during burnout, I tried to do at least something:\n\n* read docs\n* watch a tech video\n* build a tiny feature\n* solve one easy problem\n* again solve a old problem\n\nMinimum consistency kept me alive.\n\n# TLDR\n\n* CSE batch 2026\n* Applied through Glassdoor\n* Backend and AI Engineering\n* Major Programming Languages: Python &amp; Java\n* Stack: FastAPI, Spring Boot, LangChain etc\n* 200+ LeetCode problems\n* 860+ GitHub contributions in 2025\n* Used Notion to track all applications\n* Resume made in Overleaf\n* Stayed active on LinkedIn and GitHub\n* Development + fundamentals matter a lot\n* DSA alone is not enough\n\nUsed AI to refine the post", "author_fullname": "t2_sksj2491", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "1 Lakh stipend guy | journey here", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Placements / Jobs"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Btechtards", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_1qxbaoz", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1253, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Placements / Jobs", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 1253, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "", "edited": 1770364846.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1770363270.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.Btechtards", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello everyone. I am the guy who got the 1 lakh rupees monthly stipend. Many of you asked me to share my journey, my preparation, and the whole process.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First, I am really sorry for not replying to DMs or comments. My inbox had more than 300 messages and the post had around 650 comments. I couldn\u2019t reply to everyone. But thank you to all of you. I am genuinely happy if my story inspired even a few people.&lt;br/&gt;\nSome people thought the post was fake or karma farming. I don\u2019t know how to prove anything, so I will just share my journey here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here is the link to my previous post: &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Btechtards/s/zBUfBckd85\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/Btechtards/s/zBUfBckd85&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;My Background&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned before, I am from a lower middle class family in a tier 2 city in South India. I was doing well in studies until 10th grade. My family believed in me so much that they even took EMI to get me online coaching for JEE.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I don\u2019t know what happened during 11th and 12th. I suddenly lost interest in studying. I didn\u2019t prepare properly for JEE and my board exams. I somehow got 80 percent in boards and 49 percentile in JEE Mains.&lt;br/&gt;\nBecause of that, I joined a tier 3 college in my city in the CSE department (2026 batch).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After the results, I regretted it a lot. I felt guilty for wasting my family\u2019s money. I knew that if I had prepared properly for 1 or 2 attempts, I could have cracked JEE. But I didn\u2019t do it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So when I joined college, I made a promise to myself. Either crack into an IIT or NIT for post graduation or compete and win in the real world even without those tags.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;College Journey&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the first year, I discovered LinkedIn. Our institution forced everyone to post at least once a month. Most students ignored it or posted random copy-pasted content from ChatGPT.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I understood that LinkedIn could be useful. So I spent a lot of time building my profile, doing certifications, and working on projects in AI, cloud, and development.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;My First Internship&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At the end of my second year, I got an internship at a startup because of my projects. It was a Generative AI Engineering role. I learned a lot about building AI-based applications.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The experience was not great overall, but it helped me explore the field.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In my third year (6th semester), I resigned and decided to focus on DSA and placements.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;My DSA Struggle&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Honestly, DSA was very tough for me in the beginning. I couldn\u2019t solve even a single problem on LeetCode. &lt;strong&gt;Using GPT and Claude heavily during my internship had made me depend too much on them.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I started from the basics. I solved easy problems on HackerRank first and slowly moved to LeetCode. I eventually got 5-star gold badges in both Python and Java on HackerRank.&lt;br/&gt;\nI have solved a little more than 200 problems on LeetCode till now. Yes, it is low.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But here is the truth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Only doing DSA will not help you much.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know many people in my college who solved way more problems, but they cannot even build simple things like authentication for an application.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Why My Profile Stood Out&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I was good at development. I built projects that solved real problems. They were not huge or fancy, but they had purpose. This gave me a lot of attention during interviews and also on LinkedIn.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;In 2025, I had more than 860 GitHub contributions from personal learning and freelancing projects. I did AI-assisted coding, but I understood the fundamentals. I always stayed updated in the tech I was interested in.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I can see there are lot comments to share my profile links, but I can&amp;#39;t share my profiles due to privacy concerns.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;The Dark Phases&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have gone through a lot of dark phases. &lt;em&gt;Losing interest, feeling empty, burnout, confusion, and a lot more.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I always tried to maintain at least a little consistency in something.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I faced a lot of rejections. Many companies didn\u2019t shortlist me. Some ghosted me.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Campus Placements:&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;During campus placements, I got a 4 LPA offer from a WITCH company in October 2025. It felt good, but I wasn\u2019t satisfied. I knew I could do better.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I kept applying for bigger companies and good startups.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;How I Applied:&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I used a Notion Kanban board to track my applications. There are multiple templates, you can use whatever you like.&lt;br/&gt;\nlink:  &lt;a href=\"https://www.notion.com/templates/category/job-application-tracking\"&gt;https://www.notion.com/templates/category/job-application-tracking&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\nThis helped me a lot. It showed me progress even when I felt I wasn\u2019t moving forward.&lt;br/&gt;\nIt also helped me understand which type of roles were responding and which ones weren\u2019t.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I made my resume using Overleaf. There are many good templates online. Just avoid multi-column layouts because some ATS systems do not parse them well. &lt;strong&gt;You don\u2019t need a \u201cperfect score\u201d resume analyzer.&lt;/strong&gt; Use GPT or Gemini to fix grammar and formatting and you are good to go.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;The Turning Point: December 2025&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;December was the month that changed everything.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got a 7 LPA offer from a cybersecurity startup for the AI engineer role. On the same day, I got a call from a big US-based company for a role I had applied for a month before.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When the HR told me the stipend was 1 lakh per month, I was shocked. It was 10 times my previous stipend (10k) and 20 times my first stipend (5k). And they had only one intern position in the team.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I decided to give my best without thinking too much about the result, since i had two offers in hand for the backup instead of pressurizing myself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Round 1:&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The interview happened for around 1 hour and had questions from:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;my resume&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;my projects&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;backend concepts like authentication ,DBMS, etc.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;some cloud related questions&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;DSA in the last 20-30 minutes&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The interviewer was kind and supportive. I got the next round invite that evening. I was happy that i made it till this far. My confidence was also increased but i didn&amp;#39;t pressurized myself again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Round 2&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This round was with a senior manager. He asked about  my projects, system design and lot of fundamentals again. At the end, he even told me I needed to learn some concepts better. So I thought I was rejected.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had other interviews that day, so I continued preparing for them. I dint worried about this interview and I was genuinely happy to make progress this far.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;The Result&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Next morning, I woke up and saw an email from them.
