Playwright with the skills located at [playwright-cli](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-cli). This brings the long-awaited official SKILL-focused CLI mode to our story and makes it more coding agent-friendly.\r\n\r\n> It is the first snapshot with the essential command set (which is already larger than the original MCP!), but we expect it to grow rapidly. Unlike the token use, that one we expect to go down since snapshots are no longer forced into the LLM!\r\n\r\n## Timeline\r\n\r\nIf you're using [merged reports](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-sharding#merging-reports-from-multiple-environments), the HTML report Speedboard tab now shows the Timeline:\r\n\r\n![Timeline chart in the HTML report](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/blob/main/docs/src/images/timeline.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n## UI Mode and Trace Viewer Improvements\r\n- New 'system' theme option follows your OS dark/light mode preference\r\n- Search functionality (Cmd/Ctrl+F) is now available in code editors\r\n- Network details panel has been reorganized for better usability\r\n- JSON responses are now automatically formatted for readability\r\n\r\nThanks to [@cpAdm](https://github.com/cpAdm) for contributing these improvements!\r\n\r\n## Miscellaneous\r\n\r\n[browserType.connectOverCDP()](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-browsertype#browser-type-connect-over-cdp) now accepts an `isLocal` option. When set to `true`, it tells Playwright that it runs on the same host as the CDP server, enabling file system optimizations.\r\n\r\n## Breaking Changes \u26a0\ufe0f\r\n- Removed `_react` and `_vue` selectors. See [locators guide](https://playwright.dev/docs/locators) for alternatives.\r\n- Removed `:light` selector engine suffix. Use standard CSS selectors instead.\r\n- Option `devtools` from [browserType.launch()](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-browsertype#browser-type-launch) has been removed. Use `args: ['--auto-open-devtools-for-tabs']` instead.\r\n- Removed macOS 13 support for WebKit. We recommend to upgrade your macOS version, or keep using an older Playwright version.\r\n\r\n## Browser Versions\r\n- Chromium 145.0.7632.6\r\n- Mozilla Firefox 146.0.1\r\n- WebKit 26.0\r\n\r\nThis version was also tested against the following stable channels:\r\n- Google Chrome 144\r\n- Microsoft Edge 144\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/playwright/releases/279314355/reactions", "total_count": 50, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 32, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 18, "eyes": 0}}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/playwright/releases/265078224", "assets_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/playwright/releases/265078224/assets", "upload_url": "https://uploads.github.com/repos/microsoft/playwright/releases/265078224/assets{?name,label}", "html_url": "https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/releases/tag/v1.57.0", "id": 265078224, "author": {"login": "Skn0tt", "id": 14912729, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTEyNzI5", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14912729?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Skn0tt", "html_url": "https://github.com/Skn0tt", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Skn0tt/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Skn0tt/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Skn0tt/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Skn0tt/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Skn0tt/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Skn0tt/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Skn0tt/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Skn0tt/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Skn0tt/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "node_id": "RE_kwDODTssw84PzMXQ", "tag_name": "v1.57.0", "target_commitish": "release-1.57", "name": "v1.57.0", "draft": false, "immutable": false, "prerelease": false, "created_at": "2025-11-25T11:10:17Z", "updated_at": "2025-11-28T15:35:41Z", "published_at": "2025-11-25T11:16:13Z", "assets": [], "tarball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/playwright/tarball/v1.57.0", "zipball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/playwright/zipball/v1.57.0", "body": "## Speedboard\r\n\r\nIn HTML reporter, there's a new tab we call \"Speedboard\":\r\n\r\n<img width=\"600\" alt=\"speedboard\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4ba117ea-ea94-4b6a-82b2-8bbd00dfe81c\" />\r\n\r\nIt shows you all your executed tests sorted by slowness,\r\nand can help you understand where your test suite is taking longer than expected.\r\nTake a look at yours - maybe you'll find some tests that are spending a longer time waiting than they should!\r\n\r\n## Chrome for Testing\r\n\r\nStarting with this release, Playwright switches from Chromium, to using [Chrome for Testing](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/chrome-for-testing/) builds. Both headed and headless browsers are subject to this. Your tests should still be passing after upgrading to Playwright 1.57.\r\n\r\nWe're expecting no functional changes to come from this switch. The biggest change is the new icon and title in your toolbar.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"500\" alt=\"new and old logo\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e9a5c4f2-9f35-4c27-9382-0f5eda377097\" />\r\n\r\nIf you still see an unexpected behaviour change, please [file an issue](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/issues/new).\r\n\r\nOn Arm64 Linux, Playwright continues to use Chromium.\r\n\r\n## Waiting for webserver output\r\n\r\n[testConfig.webServer](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-testconfig#test-config-web-server) added a `wait` field. Pass a regular expression, and Playwright will wait until the webserver logs match it.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';\r\n\r\nexport default defineConfig({\r\n  webServer: {\r\n    command: 'npm run start',\r\n    wait: {\r\n      stdout: '/Listening on port (?<my_server_port>\\\\d+)/'\r\n    },\r\n  },\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you include a named capture group into the expression, then Playwright will provide the capture group contents via environment variables:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';\r\n\r\ntest.use({ baseUrl: `http://localhost:${process.env.MY_SERVER_PORT ?? 3000}` });\r\n\r\ntest('homepage', async ({ page }) => {\r\n  await page.goto('/');\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is not just useful for capturing varying ports of dev servers. You can also use it to wait for readiness of a service that doesn't expose an HTTP readiness check, but instead prints a readiness message to stdout or stderr.\r\n\r\n## Breaking Change\r\n\r\nAfter 3 years of being deprecated, we removed `Page#accessibility` from our API. Please use other libraries such as [Axe](https://www.deque.com/axe/) if you need to test page accessibility. See our Node.js [guide](https://playwright.dev/docs/accessibility-testing) for integration with Axe.\r\n\r\n## New APIs\r\n- New property [testConfig.tag](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-testconfig#test-config-tag) adds a tag to all tests in this run. This is useful when using [merge-reports](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-sharding#merging-reports-from-multiple-shards).\r\n- [worker.on('console')](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-worker#worker-event-console) event is emitted when JavaScript within the worker calls one of console API methods, e.g. console.log or console.dir. [worker.waitForEvent()](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-worker#worker-wait-for-event) can be used to wait for it.\r\n- [locator.description()](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-locator#locator-description) returns locator description previously set with [locator.describe()](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-locator#locator-describe), and `Locator.toString()` now uses the description when available.\r\n- New option [`steps`](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-locator#locator-click-option-steps) in [locator.click()](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-locator#locator-click) and [locator.dragTo()](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-locator#locator-drag-to) that configures the number of `mousemove` events emitted while moving the mouse pointer to the target element.\r\n- Network requests issued by [Service Workers](https://playwright.dev/docs/service-workers#network-events-and-routing) are now reported and can be routed through the [BrowserContext](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-browsercontext), only in Chromium. You can opt out using the `PLAYWRIGHT_DISABLE_SERVICE_WORKER_NETWORK` environment variable.\r\n- Console messages from Service Workers are dispatched through [worker.on('console')](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-worker#worker-event-console). You can opt out of this using the `PLAYWRIGHT_DISABLE_SERVICE_WORKER_CONSOLE` environment variable.\r\n\r\n## Browser Versions\r\n- Chromium 143.0.7499.4\r\n- Mozilla Firefox 144.0.2\r\n- WebKit 26.0", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/playwright/releases/265078224/reactions", "total_count": 117, "+1": 36, "-1": 0, "laugh": 1, "hooray": 46, "confused": 0, "heart": 17, "rocket": 12, "eyes": 5}}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/playwright/releases/255178182", "assets_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/playwright/releases/255178182/assets", "upload_url": "https://uploads.github.com/repos/microsoft/playwright/releases/255178182/assets{?name,label}", "html_url": "https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/releases/tag/v1.56.1", "id": 255178182, "author": {"login": "yury-s", "id": 9798949, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjk3OTg5NDk=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9798949?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/yury-s", "html_url": "https://github.com/yury-s", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yury-s/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yury-s/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yury-s/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yury-s/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yury-s/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yury-s/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yury-s/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yury-s/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yury-s/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "node_id": "RE_kwDODTssw84PNbXG", "tag_name": "v1.56.1", "target_commitish": "release-1.56", "name": "v1.56.1", "draft": false, "immutable": false, "prerelease": false, "created_at": "2025-10-17T00:48:28Z", "updated_at": "2025-10-17T00:50:36Z", "published_at": "2025-10-17T00:50:36Z", "assets": [], "tarball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/playwright/tarball/v1.56.1", "zipball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/playwright/zipball/v1.56.1", "body": "## Highlights\r\n\r\n#37871 chore: allow local-network-access permission in chromium\r\n#37891 fix(agents): remove workspaceFolder ref from vscode mcp\r\n#37759 chore: rename agents to test agents\r\n#37757 chore(mcp): fallback to cwd when resolving test config\r\n\r\n## Browser Versions\r\n- Chromium 141.0.7390.37\r\n- Mozilla Firefox 142.0.1\r\n- WebKit 26.0\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/playwright/releases/255178182/reactions", "total_count": 48, "+1": 25, "-1": 0, "laugh": 1, "hooray": 6, "confused": 0, "heart": 8, "rocket": 4, "eyes": 4}}]}
