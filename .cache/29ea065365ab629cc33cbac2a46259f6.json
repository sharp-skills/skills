But then it became a pattern. \nI pushed back and reminded him that it was during my break, and he said, \u201cWell, we all have to make sacrifices sometimes.\u201d\n\nCool. Got it.\n\nNext meeting, I showed up with a full plate of spaghetti and meatballs. Had my camera on and mic unmuted, slurping and chewing, occasionally gave thumbs up while mid-bite. \n\nFew days later it repeated so I brought sticky wings. Last week on Thursday it happened again, glad I still had my pizza.\n\nHe finally asked: \u201cDo you have to eat during the meeting?\u201d\n\nI smiled and said, \u201cWe all have to make sacrifices sometimes.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s Friday today. We didn\u2019t have any meetings during my lunch hours this week. \n\nUPDATE: three awards! Wow. Thank you so much. I\u2019ll eat something crunchy next, just for you.\n\nUPDATE: Fourth award? Okay fine, next meeting I\u2019m bringing sushi and miso soup - with slurping.\n\nUPDATE: FIFTH award??! Holy moly. You people are unhinged and I love it. I guess it\u2019s time for crab legs.\n\nUPDATE: SIXTH award?? What is happening?? I\u2019m bringing a fondue pot. Not joking. I\u2019m heating cheese mid-meeting.\n\nUPDATE: SEVENTH award?! WHAT! OK, after fondue we do a whole tomahawk steak! Bone-in. And I will carve it live on camera like it\u2019s a cooking show.\n\nUPDATE: EIGHTH award??? Are you kidding me?? I\u2019m adding a rotisserie attachment. Whole chicken\u2019s spinning behind me while I scream about burndown charts. We\u2019re marinating in velocity now.\n\nUPDATE: NINTH award?? YOU MONSTERS. Fine.\nAlright, no more playing: I\u2019m sourcing a miniature hibachi grill. I\u2019m doing full hibachi chef cosplay. There will be onion volcanoes. There will be fire.\n\nUPDATE: TENTH award!! What is wrong with you people!! Now I have to flamb\u00e9 something live. I don\u2019t even know what yet - maybe bananas, maybe my resignation letter. There will be a smoke alarm, and I will not be muting my mic!!\n\nUPDATE: ELEVENTH award?? I hate all of you. I\u2019m wheeling in a backyard BBQ smoker. Brisket is on. Ribs are prepped. I\u2019m giving sprint updates in a bathrobe, wielding meat tongs. This might be my last Zoom meeting. I don\u2019t care. This is your fault.\n\nUPDATE: TWELFTH award?? ICONIC 250 GOLD?? What even is that?! I didn\u2019t even know this thing existed!\nYou guys just keep raising the bar on chaos. Honestly, I\u2019m impressed and slightly terrified.\n\nThe backyard BBQ smoker now has disco lights and a fog machine. The HR is cheering. I\u2019m indoors wearing sunglasses, pulling off dance moves I definitely shouldn\u2019t. \n\nUPDATE: THIRTEENTH award?? YOU GUYS ARE OUT OF YOUR MINDS!! You also wanted fish? FINE. I\u2019m unveiling a full-blown human-size sashimi boat. It\u2019s on dry ice. There\u2019s a decorative koi fountain.\n\nUPDATE: FOURTEENTH award?? DO YOU ALL EVER SLEEP? I brought in two portable pizza ovens. One for Neapolitan, one for Detroit-style. Dough is flying. I\u2019m one burnt crust away from accidentally pitching the MVP launch as a new pizza topping. \n\nUPDATE: FIFTEENTH award?? OK, this HAS TO STOP! The meeting now includes a towering seafood platter on ice. Lobster tails. Giant prawns. Caviar. I\u2019m drizzling lemon with tweezers while shouting burn rate numbers.\n\nUPDATE: SIXTEENTH award?? WHAT DID I EVER DO TO DESERVE THIS?!\nA whole bluefin tuna brought straight from Tsukiji is being carved behind me. I\u2019m not doing it alone anymore - I hired a chef. There\u2019s dramatic music. I\u2019m delivering roadmap updates like a food network finale. \n\nUPDATE: SEVENTEENTH award?? No seriously WHO IS BEHIND THIS?!\nIt\u2019s wagyu time. I\u2019ve got A5 ribeye from Miyazaki, sea urchin butter, and a tabletop lava stone grill sizzling like a death ritual. I\u2019m searing slices with gold chopsticks while spooning caviar onto bone marrow toast between velocity updates. It\u2019s show time!\n\nUPDATE: EIGHTEENTH award?? YOU ABSOLUTE MENACES.\nI\u2019ve called in a Cantonese roast master. There\u2019s lacquered duck, goose, and char siu glistening under studio lights. Each cut is plated with edible orchids. The fat crackles when you look at it wrong. I\u2019m presenting KPIs while brushing glaze with a horsehair brush like I\u2019m restoring fine art.\n\nUPDATE: NINETEENTH award?? YOU HAVE TOO MUCH POWER AND ZERO IMPULSE CONTROL.\nThere\u2019s a nine-course kaiseki service unfolding mid-standup. The chef doesn\u2019t speak, he only nods. Plates arrive on a conveyor of polished stone with gold leaf. There\u2019s a matcha ceremony happening during the KPI review.\n\nUPDATE: TWENTIETH award? IS THIS A CULT NOW? A full scale conveyor belt sushi system is now looping around my home office. Every Jira ticket update is accompanied by toro, tamago, or an aggressive wasabi bomb. I\u2019m doing retros in haiku while the cat rides the belt like royalty.\n\n\nThanks for making this madness happen. You\u2019re all too much, and I mean that in the best way.\n\n\n&gt;!P.S. If my manager asks why there was smoke and EDM lights in our last meeting, I\u2019m forwarding them this post. You did this.
