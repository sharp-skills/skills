[(Docs)](https://typesense.org/docs/30.0/api/synonyms.html)\r\n- **Global Curation Rules**: Curations are also top-level resources now, and can be shared between multiple collections. [(Docs)](https://typesense.org/docs/30.0/api/curation.html)\r\n- **New features in JOINs**:\r\n  - `facet_by` now supports JOINed reference fields. [(Docs)](https://typesense.org/docs/30.0/api/search.html#facet-referencing)\r\n  - Fetch related docs count for a document in a joined collection with the `include_fields` param. [(Docs)](https://typesense.org/docs/30.0/api/joins.html#get-number-of-related-documents)\r\n  - Support sorting and limit on joined fields with `include_fields` parameter. [(Docs)](https://typesense.org/docs/30.0/api/joins.html#Sorting-and-limiting-on-joined-collection-docs)\r\n  - Support for altering reference fields in the collection schema.\r\n  - New `cascade_delete: false` JOIN parameter for a `reference` field, to override the default behavior of document being cascade deleted in case all the documents it references are deleted.\r\n    Requires `async_reference` parameter to be `true`. [(Docs)](https://typesense.org/docs/30.0/api/joins.html#cascade-delete)\r\n- **New features in Union Search**:\r\n  - Support for `group_by` with Union search. [(Docs)](https://typesense.org/docs/30.0/api/federated-multi-search.html#grouping-with-union)\r\n  - Support for the `pinned_hits` search parameter in Union search.\r\n  - Support for filtering out duplicates when using Union search with a new flag called `remove_duplicates`. [(Docs)](https://typesense.org/docs/30.0/api/federated-multi-search.html#removing-duplicates-in-union-search)\r\n- **Facet Sampling**: Make facet sampling dynamic using the new `facet_sample_slope` search parameter.

[(Docs)](https://typesense.org/docs/30.0/api/collections.html#field-parameters)\r\n- Return an error message when a field is declared that references another field of the same collection.\r\n- New `group_max_candidates` search parameter which overrides the behavior of `group_by` queries introduced in [v29.0](https://typesense.org/docs/29.0/api/#deprecations-behavior-changes) where `found` value is an approximation. When `group_max_candidates` is passed, `found` will be accurate up until its value. [(Docs)](https://typesense.org/docs/30.0/api/search.html#grouping-parameters)\r\n- Allow non-indexed nested fields to still be marked as required.\r\n- Improved synonym matching logic: Previously, synonym matches with a higher number of tokens (query/synonym) would be ranked higher. Now, matches are ranked by how well they match the query/synonyms overall, not just by the number of matched tokens.\r\n- Use Transliterator objects pool to enhance tokenization performance of Cyrillic and Chinese languages.\r\n- Support for dynamic `facet_return_parent` fields. [(Docs)](https://typesense.org/docs/30.0/api/search.html#faceting-parameters)\r\n- Support for sending an empty array to avoid embedding generation for an optional auto embedding field when indexing a document.\r\n- Highlight the actual search query when augmenting the search query with Natural Language search.\r\n- Enhance image embedding models support by adding CLIP Multilingual Model support.\r\n- Support for synonym matching in curations.

We now have a top-level resource called a \"**Synonym Set**\" which is a list of synonyms that can be attached to one or more collections, or can be dynamically sent as a search parameter. Existing synonyms will be auto-migrated to synonym sets automatically on upgrading. [(Docs)](https://typesense.org/docs/30.0/api/synonyms.html)\r\n- **Overrides** (aka Curation Rules) are no longer nested under Collections. Similar to synonym sets, we now have a top-level resource called a \"**Curation Set**\" that can be attached to one or more collections, or can be dynamically sent as a search parameter. Existing overrides will be auto-migrated to curation sets automatically on upgrading. The [`override_tags`](https://typesense.org/docs/29.0/api/search.html#ranking-and-sorting-parameters) parameter has also been renamed to `curation_tags`. [(Docs)](https://typesense.org/docs/30.0/api/curation.html)\r\n- The structure of **Analytics Rules** has changed. Old rules will be automatically migrated to the new structure internally. Read more here. [(Docs)](https://typesense.org/docs/30.0/api/analytics-query-suggestions.html)\r\n- The export endpoint doesn't stop streaming the response if an error is encountered while loading a document from disk. The error is logged and is also returned in the response stream.\r\n- Collections having references to each other are not allowed. If mutual reference is detected, the reference field will not be indexed.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Upgrading\r\n\r\nBefore upgrading your existing Typesense cluster to v30.0, please review the behavior changes above to prepare your application for the upgrade.\r\n\r\nPlease make sure to **update your client libraries** to the latest version, **review the specific documentation links provided above** and make any required changes to your code base if you programmatically create these resources using the API, before upgrading to this version. \r\n\r\nWe'd recommend testing on your development / staging environments before upgrading. \r\n\r\n### Typesense Cloud\r\n\r\nIf you're on Typesense Cloud:\r\n\r\n1. Go to [https://cloud.typesense.org/clusters](https://cloud.typesense.org/clusters).\r\n2. Click on your cluster\r\n3. Click on \"Cluster Configuration\" on the left-side pane, and then click on \"Modify\"\r\n4. Select a new Typesense Server version in the dropdown\r\n5. Schedule a time for the upgrade.\r\n\r\n### Self Hosted\r\n\r\nIf you're self-hosting Typesense, here are instructions on how to upgrade: [Docs](https://typesense.org/docs/guide/updating-typesense.html#typesense-self-hosted)\r\n\r\n\u26a0\ufe0f **IMPORTANT**: When self-hosting, please [**initiate a snapshot**](https://typesense.org/docs/30.0/api/cluster-operations.html#create-snapshot-for-backups) before upgrading, for the Synonyms & Overrides to be migrated to v30.\r\n\r\n## Downgrading\r\n\r\nIf you use synonyms, overrides (curation rules) or analytics rules in previous versions of Typesense, we will auto-migrate them to the new resources (Synonym Sets, Curation Sets and the new format for analytics rules) on upgrading. However, if you make any changes to these resources, and then downgrade later, those changes will NOT be ported back to the old version after downgrade.\r\n\r\nBesides the above caveat, you can downgrade to any version above `v27`.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\nView the complete API documentation for this release here: [https://typesense.org/docs/30.0/api/](https://typesense.org/docs/30.0/api/)", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/typesense/typesense/releases/280407774/reactions", "total_count": 27, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 12, "confused": 0, "heart": 6, "rocket": 9, "eyes": 0}}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/typesense/typesense/releases/228656573", "assets_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/typesense/typesense/releases/228656573/assets", "upload_url": "https://uploads.github.com/repos/typesense/typesense/releases/228656573/assets{?name,label}", "html_url": "https://github.com/typesense/typesense/releases/tag/v29.0", "id": 228656573, "author": {"login": "kishorenc", "id": 782073, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjc4MjA3Mw==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/782073?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/kishorenc", "html_url": "https://github.com/kishorenc", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kishorenc/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kishorenc/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kishorenc/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kishorenc/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kishorenc/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kishorenc/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kishorenc/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kishorenc/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kishorenc/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "node_id": "RE_kwDOBLpIx84NoQW9", "tag_name": "v29.0", "target_commitish": "v29", "name": "Version 29.0", "draft": false, "immutable": false, "prerelease": false, "created_at": "2025-06-30T02:49:53Z", "updated_at": "2025-06-30T20:48:49Z", "published_at": "2025-06-30T03:52:33Z", "assets": [], "tarball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/typesense/typesense/tarball/v29.0", "zipball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/typesense/typesense/zipball/v29.0", "body": "This release contains important new features, performance improvements and bug fixes.\r\n\r\n### New Features\r\n\r\n- **Natural Language Search:** Typesense can now detect user intent in natural language queries and convert them into structured search queries using LLMs.\r\n  This allows a user query like `q: A Honda or BMW with at least 200 hp` to be understood and executed by Typesense as `filter_by: make:[Honda, BMW] && engine_hp:>=200` automatically. ([Docs](https://typesense.org/docs/29.0/api/natural-language-search.html))\r\n- **Dynamic Sorting in Overrides:** Typesense now supports dynamic sorting rules within override definitions, similar to dynamic filtering.\r\n  This enables query-dependent sorting of results through override rules ([Docs](https://typesense.org/docs/29.0/api/curation.html#dynamic-sorting)).\r\n- **Filter multiple properties within a nested array of objects**: You can now scope filter expressions to a specific nested object within an array field ([Docs](https://typesense.org/docs/guide/tips-for-filtering.html#filtering-nested-array-objects)).\r\n- **Streaming support for conversations:** responses from LLM APIs are now directly streamed, allowing you to build interactive chat experiences. ([Docs](https://typesense.org/docs/29.0/api/conversational-search-rag.html#streaming-conversations)).\r\n- **Support adding meta fields to query analytics documents**: You can now pass the `filter_by` search parameter and a new `analytics_tag` search parameter that you can set to any string you need, to be stored with your popular and no-hits queries. This gives you additional context around the search. ([Docs](https://typesense.org/docs/29.0/api/analytics-query-suggestions.html#query-analytics-with-meta-fields)).\r\n- You can now fetch JOIN reference fields in the GET document API ([Docs](https://typesense.org/docs/29.0/api/joins.html#reference-fields-in-document-retrieval))\r\n\r\n### Enhancements\r\n\r\n- Improved group-by performance and resource usage, especially when high cardinality fields (like `productId`) are used for grouping.\r\n- Improved performance of numeric range queries.\r\n- Return uniform API response structure when `union: true` is set, regardless of number of collections queried.\r\n- Ability to customize RocksDB parameters like write buffer sizes for better performance. ([Docs](https://typesense.org/docs/29.0/api/server-configuration.html#on-disk-db-fine-tuning)).\r\n- Support for filtering with nested object fields in overrides.\r\n- Ability to do image search using user-uploaded images at runtime ([Docs](https://typesense.org/docs/29.0/api/image-search.html#search-for-similar-images-with-dynamic-image)).\r\n- Support for configuring the max `group_limit` via a new server-side parameter called `max-group-limit` ([Docs](https://typesense.org/docs/29.0/api/server-configuration.html#search-limits)).\r\n- Support caching for remote query embeddings via `embedding-cache-num-entries` server-side parameter ([Docs](https://typesense.org/docs/29.0/api/server-configuration.html#resource-usage)).\r\n- Support for sorting when doing a one-to-many JOIN ([Docs](https://typesense.org/docs/29.0/api/joins.html#sorting-on-one-to-many-joins)).\r\n- Support for bucketing on vector distance ([Docs](https://typesense.org/docs/29.0/api/vector-search.html#vector-distance-bucketing)).\r\n- Improved synonym matching when multiple synonym definitions match a given search query. \r\n- New Cache hit/miss statistics (`cache_hit_count`, `cache_miss_count`, `cache_hit_ratio`) are now exposed in `stats.json`\r\n- Support for Azure OpenAI and Google Gemini in conversation models.\r\n- Support dimension truncation for GCP text embedding models, by setting `num_dim`.\r\n- Add support for Azure OpenAI for embedding generation.\r\n- Support for `document_task` and `query_task` support for GCP text embedding models.\r\n- Support for OpenAI compatible conversation models using the `openai_url` (base) and `openai_path` parameters.\r\n- The region parameter is now configurable for GCP models for text embedding.\r\n\r\n### Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n- Fixed a few bugs related to updates of deeply nested field values.\r\n- Fixed phrase search queries being stemmed.\r\n- Respect field-level tokenization config in filters.\r\n- Fixed facet sum being wrong when negative values are added.\r\n- Fixed vector query parsing with backticks escaping special characters. \r\n- Improve reliability of joins during imports.\r\n- Fixed broken `cache-num-entries` server side parameter.\r\n- Exclude x-typesense-user-id from cache key to make cache global. \r\n- Fixed import of large stemming dictionaries.\r\n- Fixed auth token refreshing problem for GCP-based embedding generation.\r\n- Fixed vector search not working reliably with 3 `sort_by` fields.\r\n- Fixed a bug caused by using `flat_search_cutoff` along with filtering for vector search.\r\n- Tweak rank computation for fusion scoring - two keyword search results with same text match score should have the same keyword search rank.\r\n- Improved reliability of CLIP embeddings under high concurrency.\r\n- Fixed a bug with collection truncation, requiring unnecessary parameters. \r\n- Fixed a bug where the alter operations endpoint was returning the incorrect document counter.\r\n- Fixed a bug where analytics counters only worked with int32 fields.\r\n\r\n### Deprecations / behavior changes\r\n\r\n-  For `group_by` queries, the `found` value returned in the response is no longer an exact number. It's an \r\n   approximation of the number of groups found, and is guaranteed to be within 2% of the actual number of groups found.\r\n\r\n## Upgrading\r\n\r\nBefore upgrading your existing Typesense cluster to v29.0, please review the behavior changes above to prepare your application for the upgrade.\r\n\r\nWe'd recommend testing on your development / staging environments before upgrading. \r\n\r\n### Typesense Cloud\r\n\r\nIf you're on Typesense Cloud:\r\n\r\n1.

(https://github.com/typesense/typesense/pull/2051)\r\n- Dictionary based stemming: stemming is now configurable through an import of a custom dictionary that maps a word to a root form. (https://github.com/typesense/typesense/pull/2062) \r\n- Allow search results to be randomized via `sort_by=_rand(seed)` clause. (https://github.com/typesense/typesense/pull/1918)\r\n- Ability to re-rank hybrid search hits by augmenting their keyword / semantic match score when the \r\n  hit was identified by only either keyword or vector search. (https://github.com/typesense/typesense/pull/1968)\r\n- Sort hits based on a pivot value. (https://github.com/typesense/typesense/pull/2003) \r\n- Support decay functions in `sort_by` to support gaussian, linear, and exponential decay of values. (https://github.com/typesense/typesense/pull/2036) \r\n- Field level `token_separators` and `symbols_to_index` are now supported. (https://github.com/typesense/typesense/pull/2118)\r\n- Support bucketing of text match scores based on `bucket_size` parameter. (https://github.com/typesense/typesense/pull/2120)\r\n- Ability to truncate a collection. (https://github.com/typesense/typesense/pull/2127)\r\n- Index and search on geo polygons. (https://github.com/typesense/typesense/pull/2150)\r\n\r\n### Enhancements\r\n\r\n- Support `distance_threshold` parameter for vector query that uses inner product distance.\r\n- Allow updating of remote model's `api_key` parameter. (https://github.com/typesense/typesense/pull/1944)\r\n- Support `max_filter_by_candidates` search parameter that controls the number of similar words that Typesense considers during fuzzy search on `filter_by` values (default is `4`).\r\n- Performance and stability fixes for joins.\r\n- API endpoint that returns status of alter schema operations that are in-progress. (https://github.com/typesense/typesense/pull/2123)\r\n- Faceting performance improvements.\r\n\r\n### Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n- Fixed fields with `async_reference` property not being restored correctly on restart. \r\n- Fixed sorting with nested reference fields.\r\n- Addressed edge cases in conversation API.\r\n- Assign default sorting score if reference is not found while sorting by a reference field.\r\n- Fix `distance_threshold` in `vector_query` not working correctly while sorting.\r\n- Add validation to ensure that embedding fields are of type `float[]`.\r\n- Fix vector query format validation error messages.\r\n- Fix race condition in high concurrency image embedding.\r\n- Fix `flat_search_cutoff` not working for hybrid search.\r\n\r\n### Deprecations / behavior changes\r\n\r\nThere are no deprecations / behavior changes in this release.\r\n\r\n## Upgrading\r\n\r\nBefore upgrading your existing Typesense cluster to v28.0, please review the behavior\r\nchanges above to prepare your application for the upgrade.\r\n\r\nWe'd recommend testing on your development / staging environments before upgrading. \r\n\r\n### Typesense Cloud\r\n\r\nIf you're on Typesense Cloud:\r\n\r\n1.
