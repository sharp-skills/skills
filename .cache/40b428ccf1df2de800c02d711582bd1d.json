{"d": "Centrifugo is an open-source scalable real-time messaging server. Centrifugo can instantly deliver messages to application online users connected over supported transports (WebSocket, HTTP-streaming, Server-Sent Events (aka EventSource), GRPC, WebTransport). Centrifugo has the concept of channel subscriptions \u2013 so it's a user-facing PUB/SUB server.\n\nCentrifugo is language-agnostic and can be used to build chat apps, live comments, multiplayer games, real-time data visualizations, collaborative tools, etc. in combination with any backend. It is well suited for modern architectures and allows decoupling the business logic from the real-time transport layer.\n\nSeveral official client SDKs for browser and mobile development wrap the bidirectional protocol. In addition, Centrifugo supports a unidirectional approach for simple use cases with no SDK dependency.\n\n## Documentation\n\n* [Centrifugo official documentation site](https://centrifugal.dev)\n* [Installation instructions](https://centrifugal.dev/docs/getting-started/installation)\n* [Getting started tutorial](https://centrifugal.dev/docs/getting-started/quickstart)\n* [Design overview and idiomatic usage](https://centrifugal.dev/docs/getting-started/design)\n* [Build a WebSocket chat/messenger app with Centrifugo](https://centrifugal.dev/docs/tutorial/intro) tutorial\n* [Centrifugal blog](https://centrifugal.dev/blog)\n* [FAQ](https://centrifugal.dev/docs/faq)\n\n## Join community\n\n* [Telegram](https://t.me/joinchat/ABFVWBE0AhkyyhREoaboXQ)\n* [Discord](https://discord.gg/tYgADKx)\n* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/centrifugalabs)\n\n## Why Centrifugo\n\nThe core idea of Centrifugo is simple \u2013 it's a PUB/SUB server on top of modern real-time transports:\n\n<img src=\"https://centrifugal.dev/img/protocol_pub_sub.png?v=2\" />\n\nThe hard part is to make this concept production-ready, efficient, flexible and available from different application environments. Centrifugo is a mature solution that already helped many projects with adding real-time features and scale towards many concurrent connections. Centrifugo provides a set of features not available in other open-source solutions in the area:\n\n* Efficient real-time transports: WebSocket, HTTP-streaming, Server-Sent Events, GRPC, WebTransport\n* Built-in scalability with Redis (or Redis Cluster, or Redis-compatible storage \u2013 ex. AWS Elasticache, Valkey, KeyDB, DragonflyDB, etc), or Nats.\n* Simple HTTP and GRPC server API to communicate with Centrifugo from the app backend\n* Asynchronous PostgreSQL and Kafka consumers to support transactional outbox and CDC patterns\n* Flexible connection authentication mechanisms: JWT and proxy-like (via request from Centrifugo to the backend)\n* Channel subscription multiplexing over a single connection\n* Different types of subscriptions: client-side and server-side\n* Various channel permission strategies, channel namespace concept\n* Hot message history in channels, with automatic message recovery upon reconnect, cache recovery mode (deliver latest publication immediately upon subscription)\n* Delta compression in channels based on Fossil algorithm\n* Online channel presence information, with join/leave notifications\n* A way to send RPC calls to the backend over the real-time connection\n* Strict and effective client protocol wrapped by several official SDKs\n* JSON and binary Protobuf message transfer, with optimized serialization and built-in batching\n* Beautiful embedded admin web UI\n* Great observability with lots of Prometheus metrics exposed and official Grafana dashboard\n* And much more, visit [Centrifugo documentation site](https://centrifugal.dev)\n\n## Backing\n\nThis repository is hosted by [packagecloud.io](https://packagecloud.io/).\n\n<a href=\"https://packagecloud.io/\"><img height=\"46\" width=\"158\" alt=\"Private NPM registry and Maven, RPM, DEB, PyPi and RubyGem Repository \u00b7 packagecloud\" src=\"https://packagecloud.io/images/packagecloud-badge.png\" /></a>\n\nAlso thanks to [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/) for supporting OSS (most of the code here written in Goland):\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jetbrains.com/\"><img height=\"140\" src=\"https://resources.jetbrains.com/storage/products/company/brand/logos/jb_beam.png\" alt=\"JetBrains logo\"></a>\n"}
