Yea... dream about it. Think about it all day.  Start making it. Never finish.  Get fired.  Research unemployment benefits.<p>20) Consider unemployment benefits as Series A funding.<p>21) Go hard, super hard, understand that you can change everything with this new software, work 24&#x2F;7, people will bother you, &quot;you should, like, hang out, take showers, and stuff.&quot; But you know, if you deliver on this, you will... doesn&#x27;t matter, something great will happen.

It seems like a vast amount of extremely hyped up new frameworks quickly fall off for use in real <em>production</em> applications. For example, Vue was extremely hyped up but React quickly won out for most real world applications. Same goes for numerous new frameworks and libraries, <em>as I'm</em> sure you all know. My question is if we could come up with some sort of a framework of criteria to help us determine if and when we should start trying to apply the 'next big thing' in our real projects. It's so important to keep our skill sets up-to-date, but obviously we can stay current with everything to a substantial level of expertise and actual understanding without trying it in a real world application. Looking forward to hearing how everyone approaches this."}, "title": {"matchLevel": "none", "matchedWords": [], "value": "Keeping Up with Coding Ecosystem"}}, "_tags": ["story", "author_katttrrr", "story_20528279", "ask_hn"], "author": "katttrrr", "children": [20528447, 20528567, 20530477], "created_at": "2019-07-25T18:54:35Z", "created_at_i": 1564080875, "num_comments": 6, "objectID": "20528279", "points": 1, "story_id": 20528279, "story_text": "Okay, this is very much a general discussion topic, but it&#x27;s something I&#x27;ve long discussed with other engineers and I&#x27;d really appreciate HN&#x27;s input. It seems like a vast amount of extremely hyped up new frameworks quickly fall off for use in real production applications. For example, Vue was extremely hyped up but React quickly won out for most real world applications. Same goes for numerous new frameworks and libraries, as I&#x27;m sure you all know.
