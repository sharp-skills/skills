The most common question: &quot;Can we get API/SDK access to build deepfake detection into our product?&quot;<p>We\u2019ve heard that from solo devs building moderation tools, fintechs adding ID verification, founders running marketplaces, and infrastructure companies protecting video calls and onboarding flows. They weren\u2019t asking us to build anything new; they simply wanted access to what we already had so they could plug it in and move forward.<p>After running pilots and engagements with customers, we\u2019re finally ready to share our public API and SDK. Now anyone can embed deepfake detection with just two lines of code, starting at the low price of free.<p><a href=\"https://www.realitydefender.com/api\">https://www.realitydefender.com/api</a><p>Our new developer tools support detection across images, voice, video, and text \u2014 with the former two available as part of the free tier. If your product touches KYC, UGC, support workflows, communications, marketplaces, or identity layers, you can now embed real-time detection directly in your stack.

This is Ben from Reality Defender (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.realitydefender.com\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.realitydefender.com</a>). We build real-time multimodal and multi-model deepfake detection for Fortune 100s and governments all over the world. (We even won the RSAC Innovation Showcase award for our work: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.prnewswire.com&#x2F;news-releases&#x2F;reality-defender-wins-most-innovative-startup-at-rsa-conference-2024-innovation-sandbox-302137326.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.prnewswire.com&#x2F;news-releases&#x2F;reality-defender-wi...</a>)<p>Today, we\u2019re excited to share our public API and SDK, allowing anyone to access our platform with 2 lines of code: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.realitydefender.com&#x2F;api\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.realitydefender.com&#x2F;api</a><p>Back in W22, we launched our product to detect AI-generated media across audio, video, and images: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=30766050\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=30766050</a><p>That post kicked off conversations with devs, security teams, researchers, and governments. The most common question: &quot;Can we get API&#x2F;SDK access to build deepfake detection into our product?&quot;<p>We\u2019ve heard that from solo devs building moderation tools, fintechs adding ID verification, founders running marketplaces, and infrastructure companies protecting video calls and onboarding flows. They weren\u2019t asking us to build anything new; they simply wanted access to what we already had so they could plug it in and move forward.<p>After running pilots and engagements with customers, we\u2019re finally ready to share our public API and SDK. Now anyone can embed deepfake detection with just two lines of code, starting at the low price of free.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.realitydefender.com&#x2F;api\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.realitydefender.com&#x2F;api</a><p>Our new developer tools support detection across images, voice, video, and text \u2014 with the former two available as part of the free tier. If your product touches KYC, UGC, support workflows, communications, marketplaces, or identity layers, you can now embed real-time detection directly in your stack.

We wanted a stack where you can see every part, fork it, self-host it, and patch it as needed.<p>Try it:<p>- Repo: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;dograh-hq&#x2F;dograh\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;dograh-hq&#x2F;dograh</a><p>This spins up a basic multilingual agent  with everything pre-wired.<p>Who this is for:<p>- If you are looking for self hosting a Vapi like platform for Data Privacy etc.<p>- Anyone trying to build production-grade voice agents without reinventing audio plumbing.<p>- If you\u2019ve tried to glue STT\u2192LLM\u2192TTS manually, you probably know the exact pain this is built for<p>Happy to answer technical questions, show the architecture, or hear how we can improve the product.", "title": "Show HN: Dograh \u2013 an OSS Vapi alternative to quickly build and test voice agents", "updated_at": "2025-12-28T09:32:54Z", "url": "https://github.com/dograh-hq/dograh"}, {"_highlightResult": {"author": {"matchLevel": "none", "matchedWords": [], "value": "soaringmonchi"}, "story_text": {"fullyHighlighted": false, "matchLevel": "full", "matchedWords": ["twilio", "production"], "value": "Hi HN<p>We built YASP because the existing free/open-source status pages were either dated, ugly, or too restrictive (no custom <em>Twilio</em>/SMTP, rigid notifications, limited customization).<p>YASP is a modern, self-hosted status page built with Next.js + Payload CMS, and it\u2019s fully open source (MIT).<p>What makes it different:<p>- Full CMS flexibility via Payload \u2013 customize almost everything without touching code<p>- Review &amp; edit every notification (SMS/email) before it\u2019s sent<p>- Bring your own <em>Twilio</em> and SMTP accounts<p>- OAuth2 / OIDC capable<p>- Beautiful dark &amp; light themes out of the box<p>- Incident updates, maintenance windows, service groups, subscriber management<p>- One-click deploy on Vercel, or self-host anywhere<p>Tech stack: Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind, Payload CMS\nOpen source &amp; free forever<p>Would love feedback from folks who\u2019ve run status pages in <em>production</em>."}, "title": {"matchLevel": "none", "matchedWords": [], "value": "Show HN: YASP \u2013 Open-source, modern status page with full CMS control"}, "url": {"matchLevel": "none", "matchedWords": [], "value": "https://yasp.io"}}, "_tags": ["story", "author_soaringmonchi", "story_46617114", "show_hn"], "author": "soaringmonchi", "created_at": "2026-01-14T15:27:12Z", "created_at_i": 1768404432, "num_comments": 0, "objectID": "46617114", "points": 14, "story_id": 46617114, "story_text": "Hi HN<p>We built YASP because the existing free&#x2F;open-source status pages were either dated, ugly, or too restrictive (no custom Twilio&#x2F;SMTP, rigid notifications, limited customization).<p>YASP is a modern, self-hosted status page built with Next.js + Payload CMS, and it\u2019s fully open source (MIT).<p>What makes it different:<p>- Full CMS flexibility via Payload \u2013 customize almost everything without touching code<p>- Review &amp; edit every notification (SMS&#x2F;email) before it\u2019s sent<p>- Bring your own Twilio and SMTP accounts<p>- OAuth2 &#x2F; OIDC capable<p>- Beautiful dark &amp; light themes out of the box<p>- Incident updates, maintenance windows, service groups, subscriber management<p>- One-click deploy on Vercel, or self-host anywhere<p>Tech stack: Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind, Payload CMS\nOpen source &amp; free forever<p>Would love feedback from folks who\u2019ve run status pages in production.", "title": "Show HN: YASP \u2013 Open-source, modern status page with full CMS control", "updated_at": "2026-01-16T02:15:00Z", "url": "https://yasp.io"}, {"_highlightResult": {"author": {"matchLevel": "none", "matchedWords": [], "value": "cashy"}, "story_text": {"fullyHighlighted": false, "matchLevel": "full", "matchedWords": ["twilio", "production"], "value": "I am having some scalability issue with a nodejs backend and was considering a full rewrite, as it was initally developed as a &quot;prototype&quot; that became the <em>production</em> app. I've been exploring using python with Django or perhaps using Go with Gin, it needs to support a few common things, mongodb, redis, <em>twilio</em> (http api) and saleforce.
