UX&#x2F;UI design is not front end development to me, it is a separate field, albeit with some overlap like accessibility.<p>I really believe the traditional role of pure front end no longer exist.<p>When JavaScript became the <i>everything</i> language (thanks nodejs), the role of front end became more integrated with back-end due to the influx of back-end devs writing JS for server side. Now we see that most &quot;front end&quot; devs don&#x27;t even write plain JavaScript, first it was TypeScript - a back-end language imo, and now we are seeing WASM as perhaps another nail in the coffin.<p>I remember reading an article on HN, proposing a &quot;front of the front end&quot; developer [0], which I think is pretty much symptomatic of the convoluted situation.<p>Before when i used to apply for jobs, i would get some kind of html&#x2F;css test. Now when i apply i get a hacker-rank test to deal with some algorithms, and i have to choose from js,ts,python,c++ etc. I think it says it all.<p>[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bradfrost.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;post&#x2F;front-of-the-front-end-and-back-of-the-front-end-web-development&#x2F;", "title": "Ask HN: Does pure Front End still exist?", "updated_at": "2024-09-20T12:03:00Z"}, {"_highlightResult": {"author": {"matchLevel": "none", "matchedWords": [], "value": "gauravFrontend"}, "story_text": {"fullyHighlighted": false, "matchLevel": "full", "matchedWords": ["jest", "production"], "value": "Location: India\nRemote: Yes!, but can do on-site/hybrid in Pune\nRole: Frontend/Software/Founding engineer full-time\nWilling to relocate: Yes, but want visa sponsorship.<p><pre><code>  Technologies: \n        \n        Languages &amp; Frameworks: TypeScript, JavaScript, React, Next.js, Node.js\n        Databases &amp; State: MongoDB, SQL (PostgreSQL/MySQL), Redux Toolkit, React Context API\n        UI &amp; Frontend: Material-UI (MUI), Tailwind CSS, SCSS, HTML5/CSS3, Responsive UI/UX Design\n        DevOps &amp; Tools: Docker, Keycloak (Auth), <em>Jest</em>, gRPC, REST APIs, Git, GitHub, Agile (Scrum)\n        AI &amp; LLM Ops: Local LLM Deployment (Ollama, vLLM), Model Quantization, Private Cloud AI Infrastructure, Stable Diffusion\n\n      R\u00e9sum\u00e9/CV: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sd7iwTgXVG2EwuOHnNxCx-MTuMhUi_Vjgfo6FCp1rR4/edit?usp=sharing\n\n  Email: gauravsharma.mern@gmail.com\n\n  Github: https://github.com/GauravFrontend\n</code></pre>\nI\u2019m a Frontend Engineer with 2 years of experience, I work daily with React, TypeScript, Next.js, Node.js and have shipped <em>production</em> features.<p>here are some things i am proud of -<p>- building chat with your docs, and something more\n- At Flipr, I optimized rendering by 70% for massive, 250+ page document platforms.\n- I don\u2019t just build UI; I\u2019ve architected RBAC systems and integrated gRPC communication for 30% faster data sync.\n- I\u2019ve worked on AI-driven recruitment tools and local LLM deployments (Ollama/vLLM), so I can help integrate AI features into your frontend.<p>I\u2019m currently looking for my next challenge where I can take full ownership of the frontend and backend to contribute to the overall architecture."}, "title": {"matchLevel": "none", "matchedWords": [], "value": "Seeking a Front End Engineer Role"}}, "_tags": ["story", "author_gauravFrontend", "story_47101213", "ask_hn"], "author": "gauravFrontend", "children": [47102109, 47107163], "created_at": "2026-02-21T14:35:52Z", "created_at_i": 1771684552, "num_comments": 2, "objectID": "47101213", "points": 2, "story_id": 47101213, "story_text": "Location: India\nRemote: Yes!, but can do on-site&#x2F;hybrid in Pune\nRole: Frontend&#x2F;Software&#x2F;Founding engineer full-time\nWilling to relocate: Yes, but want visa sponsorship.<p><pre><code>  Technologies: \n        \n        Languages &amp; Frameworks: TypeScript, JavaScript, React, Next.js, Node.js\n        Databases &amp; State: MongoDB, SQL (PostgreSQL&#x2F;MySQL), Redux Toolkit, React Context API\n        UI &amp; Frontend: Material-UI (MUI), Tailwind CSS, SCSS, HTML5&#x2F;CSS3, Responsive UI&#x2F;UX Design\n        DevOps &amp; Tools: Docker, Keycloak (Auth), Jest, gRPC, REST APIs, Git, GitHub, Agile (Scrum)\n        AI &amp; LLM Ops: Local LLM Deployment (Ollama, vLLM), Model Quantization, Private Cloud AI Infrastructure, Stable Diffusion\n\n      R\u00e9sum\u00e9&#x2F;CV: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.google.com&#x2F;document&#x2F;d&#x2F;1sd7iwTgXVG2EwuOHnNxCx-MTuMhUi_Vjgfo6FCp1rR4&#x2F;edit?usp=sharing\n\n  Email: gauravsharma.mern@gmail.com\n\n  Github: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;GauravFrontend\n</code></pre>\nI\u2019m a Frontend Engineer with 2 years of experience, I work daily with React, TypeScript, Next.js, Node.js and have shipped production features.<p>here are some things i am proud of -<p>- building chat with your docs, and something more\n- At Flipr, I optimized rendering by 70% for massive, 250+ page document platforms.\n- I don\u2019t just build UI; I\u2019ve architected RBAC systems and integrated gRPC communication for 30% faster data sync.\n- I\u2019ve worked on AI-driven recruitment tools and local LLM deployments (Ollama&#x2F;vLLM), so I can help integrate AI features into your frontend.<p>I\u2019m currently looking for my next challenge where I can take full ownership of the frontend and backend to contribute to the overall architecture.", "title": "Seeking a Front End Engineer Role", "updated_at": "2026-02-22T01:35:16Z"}, {"_highlightResult": {"author": {"matchLevel": "none", "matchedWords": [], "value": "rhinorackattack"}, "story_text": {"fullyHighlighted": false, "matchLevel": "full", "matchedWords": ["jest", "production"], "value": "Disclaimer - the goal isn't to build a fully fledged company from this.
