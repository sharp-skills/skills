It was even discussed on HN in a recent Show HN thread[1]. The  idea is for the player to drag tiles within sectors to spell four common English words.<p>After sharing the game with some people, and receiving mostly positive feedback, one of the frequently requested features was the ability to pay a small one-time fee to unlock access to the puzzle archive. I decided I should get that working before I announce the game to the intended wider audience.<p>I've been using <em>Stripe</em> for these sorts of projects for over 10 years, and it seemed like a perfect fit for this little game. I created a payment link, coded a webhook, and with a few days of coding and testing, it seemed to be working swimmingly. A few early adopters even elected to pay the $5 USD fee to unlock the archive.<p>Then on 08 May 2025, I received an email from <em>Stripe</em>:<p>&gt; <i>We\u2019re writing to let you know that we have determined that your business, Omiword (account ID: [redacted]), is in violation of the <em>Stripe</em> Services Agreement. Specifically, we are unable to accept payments for the use of <em>Stripe</em> in a manner inconsistent with its intended use such as misusing data, or using it to store value, as mentioned on our Restricted Businesses list.</i><p>I looked through the <em>Stripe</em> restricted business list[2], and I don't see anything resembling Omiword. I wrote back, explaining that this is just a free daily word game, and players have the option to pay to unlock access to older puzzles. No gambling, no in-game currency, no adult content. <em>Stripe</em> eventually wrote back to say:<p>&gt; <i>Unfortunately, following an additional review of your account we\u2019re still unable to support your business as it falls under one of our restricted businesses categories.</i><p>After further exchanges with their support, I finally got a hint what the issue might be: the initial handful of charges on the account were to my own credit card. I explained that these were just test transactions, getting the webhook working properly in <em>production</em>. I wasn't aware this was an issue. On 13 May they replied:<p>&gt; <i>We're able to continue accepting payments for your business moving forward as long as all future transactions come from customers and not from you.</i><p>Okay, I acknowledged and agreed to this stipulation. I've stuck to it. Nevertheless, <em>Stripe</em> kept sending me automated messages about my account's imminent closure. I contacted support again, and they just kept replying along the lines of, &quot;My team and I are reviewing the details. We're committed to completing this review as soon as possible.&quot;<p>Today, about two weeks after the initial notice, I received this from <em>Stripe</em>:<p>&gt; <i>This is our final notice, informing you that we\u2019ve determined that your business, Omiword (account ID: [redacted]) is in violation of the <em>Stripe</em> Services Agreement.

It was even discussed on HN in a recent Show HN thread[1]. The  idea is for the player to drag tiles within sectors to spell four common English words.<p>After sharing the game with some people, and receiving mostly positive feedback, one of the frequently requested features was the ability to pay a small one-time fee to unlock access to the puzzle archive. I decided I should get that working before I announce the game to the intended wider audience.<p>I&#x27;ve been using Stripe for these sorts of projects for over 10 years, and it seemed like a perfect fit for this little game. I created a payment link, coded a webhook, and with a few days of coding and testing, it seemed to be working swimmingly. A few early adopters even elected to pay the $5 USD fee to unlock the archive.<p>Then on 08 May 2025, I received an email from Stripe:<p>&gt; <i>We\u2019re writing to let you know that we have determined that your business, Omiword (account ID: [redacted]), is in violation of the Stripe Services Agreement. Specifically, we are unable to accept payments for the use of Stripe in a manner inconsistent with its intended use such as misusing data, or using it to store value, as mentioned on our Restricted Businesses list.</i><p>I looked through the Stripe restricted business list[2], and I don&#x27;t see anything resembling Omiword. I wrote back, explaining that this is just a free daily word game, and players have the option to pay to unlock access to older puzzles. No gambling, no in-game currency, no adult content. Stripe eventually wrote back to say:<p>&gt; <i>Unfortunately, following an additional review of your account we\u2019re still unable to support your business as it falls under one of our restricted businesses categories.</i><p>After further exchanges with their support, I finally got a hint what the issue might be: the initial handful of charges on the account were to my own credit card. I explained that these were just test transactions, getting the webhook working properly in production. I wasn&#x27;t aware this was an issue. On 13 May they replied:<p>&gt; <i>We&#x27;re able to continue accepting payments for your business moving forward as long as all future transactions come from customers and not from you.</i><p>Okay, I acknowledged and agreed to this stipulation. I&#x27;ve stuck to it. Nevertheless, Stripe kept sending me automated messages about my account&#x27;s imminent closure.
