This release marks what we're calling `v1` as a point in time to be able to reference and still use going into the future. The current architecture of Commerce is a multi-vendor, interoperable solution, including:\r\n\r\n- [Shopify](https://shopify.vercel.store/)\r\n- [Swell](https://swell.vercel.store/)\r\n- [BigCommerce](https://bigcommerce.vercel.store/)\r\n- [Vendure](https://vendure.vercel.store/)\r\n- [Saleor](https://saleor.vercel.store/)\r\n- [Ordercloud](https://ordercloud.vercel.store/)\r\n- [Spree](https://spree.vercel.store/)\r\n- [Kibo Commerce](https://kibocommerce.vercel.store/)\r\n- [Commerce.js](https://commercejs.vercel.store/)\r\n- [SalesForce Cloud Commerce](https://salesforce-cloud-commerce.vercel.store/)\r\n\r\nAll features can be toggled on or off, and it's easy to change between commerce providers. To support this, we needed to create a [\"commerce metaframework\"](https://github.com/vercel/commerce/blob/d1d9e8c4343e70d72df6e00ec95f6ea4efbb7c54/packages/commerce/new-provider.md) where providers could confirm to an API spec to add support for Next.js Commerce. While this worked and was successful for `v1`, we have different design goals and ambitions for `v2`.\r\n\r\n**What You Need To Know**\r\n\r\n- `v1` will not be updated moving forward. If you need to reference `v1`, you will still be able to clone and deploy the version tagged at this release.\r\n- `v2` will be shifting to be a single provider vs. provider agnostic. Other providers are welcome to fork this repository and swap out the underlying `lib/` implementation that connects to the selected commerce provider (Shopify). This architecture was chosen to reduce the surface area of the codebase, remove the intermediate metaframework layer for provider-interoperability, and enable usage with the latest Next.js and React features.\r\n- We will be sharing more about `v2` in the future as we continue to iterate before the marked release.\r\n\r\nThank you so much! \ud83c\udf89 ", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/commerce/releases/99836358/reactions", "total_count": 63, "+1": 53, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 6, "eyes": 4}}]}
