But why the need for a caching layer? \r\n\r\nIn Prisma 7, the query compiler runs as a WebAssembly module directly on the JavaScript main thread. While this simplified the architecture by eliminating the separate engine process, it introduced a trade-off: every query now synchronously blocks the event loop during compilation. \r\n\r\nFor individual queries, compilation takes between 0.1ms and 1ms, which is barely noticeable in isolation. But under high concurrency this overhead adds up and creates event loop contention that affects overall application throughput. \r\n\r\nFor instance, say we have a query that is run over and over, but is a similar shape: \r\n\r\n```tsx\r\n// These two queries have the same shape:\r\nconst alice = await prisma.user.findUnique({ where: { email: 'alice@prisma.io' } })\r\nconst bob = await prisma.user.findUnique({ where: { email: 'bob@prisma.io' } })\r\n```\r\n\r\nPrior to v7.4.0, this would be reevaluated ever time the query is run. Now, Prisma Client will extract the user-provided values and replaces them with typed placeholders, producing a normalized query shape:\r\n\r\n```\r\nprisma.user.findUnique({ where: { email: %1 } })   // cache key\r\n                                         \u2191\r\n                              %1 = 'alice@prisma.io'  (or 'bob@prisma.io')\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis normalized shape is used as a cache key. On the first call, the query is compiled as usual and the resulting plan is stored in an LRU cache. On every subsequent call with the same query shape, regardless of the actual values, the cached plan is reused instantly without invoking the compiler.\r\n\r\nWe have more details on the impact of this change and some deep dives into Prisma architecture in an upcoming blog post!\r\n\r\n### Partial Indexes (Filtered Indexes) Support\r\n\r\nWe're excited to announce **Partial Indexes** support in Prisma! This powerful community-contributed feature allows you to create indexes that only include rows matching specific conditions, significantly reducing index size and improving query performance.\r\n\r\nPartial indexes are available behind the `partialIndexes` preview feature for PostgreSQL, SQLite, SQL Server, and CockroachDB, with full migration and introspection support.\r\n\r\n**Basic usage**\r\n\r\nEnable the preview feature in your schema:\r\n\r\n```groovy\r\ngenerator client {\r\n  provider        = \"prisma-client-js\"\r\n  previewFeatures = [\"partialIndexes\"]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Raw SQL syntax**\r\n\r\nFor maximum flexibility, use the `raw()` function with database-specific predicates:\r\n\r\n```groovy\r\nmodel User {\r\n  id       Int     @id\r\n  email    String\r\n  status   String\r\n\r\n  @@unique([email], where: raw(\"status = 'active'\"))\r\n  @@index([email], where: raw(\"deletedAt IS NULL\"))\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Type-safe object syntax**\r\n\r\nFor better type safety, use the object literal syntax for simple conditions:\r\n\r\n```groovy\r\nmodel Post {\r\n  id        Int      @id\r\n  title     String\r\n  published Boolean\r\n\r\n  @@index([title], where: { published: true })\r\n  @@unique([title], where: { published: { not: false } })\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Bug Fixes\r\n\r\nMost of these fixes are **community contributions** - thank you to our amazing contributors!\r\n\r\n- [**prisma/prisma-engines#5767**](https://github.com/prisma/prisma-engines/pull/5767): Fixed an issue with PostgreSQL migration scripts that prevented usage of `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` in migrations\r\n- [**prisma/prisma-engines#5752**](https://github.com/prisma/prisma-engines/pull/5752): Fixed BigInt precision loss in JSON aggregation for MySQL and CockroachDB by casting BigInt values to text (from community member [polaz](https://github.com/polaz))\r\n- [**prisma/prisma-engines#5750**](https://github.com/prisma/prisma-engines/pull/5750): Fixed connection failures with non-ASCII database names by properly URL-decoding database names in connection strings\r\n- [**#29155**](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/pull/29155): Fixed silent transaction commit errors in PlanetScale adapter by ensuring COMMIT failures are properly propagated\r\n- [**#29141**](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/pull/29141): Resolved race condition errors (EREQINPROG) in SQL Server adapter by serializing commit/rollback operations using mutex synchronization\r\n- [**#29158**](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/pull/29158): Fixed MSSQL connection string parsing to properly handle curly brace escaping for passwords containing special characters\r\n\r\n## Open roles at Prisma\r\n\r\nInterested in joining Prisma?

With 7.3.0, we're introducing a new `compilerBuild` option for the client generator block in `schema.prisma` with two options: `fast` and `small`. This allows you to swap the underlying Query Compiler engine based on your selection, one built for speed (with an increase in size), and one built for size (with the trade off for speed).  By default, the `fast` mode is used, but this can be set by the user:\r\n\r\n```groovy\r\ngenerator client {\r\n  provider = \"prisma-client\"\r\n  output   = \"../src/generated/prisma\"\r\n  compilerBuild = \"fast\" // \"fast\" | \"small\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe still have more in progress for performance, but this new `compilerBuild` option is our first step toward addressing your concerns!\r\n\r\n- [#29005](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/pull/29005): Bypass the Query Compiler for Raw Queries\r\nRaw queries (`$executeRaw`, `$queryRaw`) can now skip going through the query compiler and query interpreter infrastructure. They can be sent directly to the driver adapter, removing additional overhead. \r\n\r\n- [#28965](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/pull/28965): Update MSSQL to v12.2.0\r\nThis community PR updates the `@prisma/adapter-mssql` to use MSSQL v12.2.0. Thanks [Jay-Lokhande](https://github.com/Jay-Lokhande)! \r\n\r\n- [#29001](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/pull/29001): Pin better-sqlite3 version to avoid SQLite bug\r\nAn underlying bug in SQLite 3.51.0 has affected the `better-sqlite3` adapter. We\u2019ve bumped the version that powers `@prisma/better-sqlite3` and have pinned the version to prevent any unexpected issues. If you are using `@prisma/better-sqlite3` , please upgrade to v7.3.0.\r\n\r\n- [#29002](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/pull/29002): Revert `@map` enums to v6.19.0 behavior\r\nIn the initial release of v7.0, we made a change with Mapped Enums where the generated enum would get its value from the value passed to the `@map` function. This was a breaking change from v6 that caused issues for many users. We have reverted this change for the time being, as many different diverging approaches have emerged from the community discussion.\r\n\r\n- [prisma-engines#5745](https://github.com/prisma/prisma-engines/pull/5745): Cast BigInt to text in JSON aggregation\r\nWhen using\u00a0`relationJoins`\u00a0with BigInt fields in Prisma 7, JavaScript's\u00a0`JSON.parse`\u00a0loses precision for integers larger than\u00a0`Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`\u00a0(2^53 - 1). This happens because PostgreSQL's\u00a0`JSONB_BUILD_OBJECT`\u00a0returns BigInt values as JSON numbers, which JavaScript cannot represent precisely.\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    // Original BigInt ID: 312590077454712834\r\n    // After JSON.parse: 312590077454712830 (corrupted!)\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    This PR cast BigInt columns to\u00a0`::text`\u00a0inside\u00a0`JSONB_BUILD_OBJECT`\u00a0calls, similar to how `MONEY` is already cast to\u00a0`::numeric`.\r\n    \r\n    ```\r\n    -- Before\r\n    JSONB_BUILD_OBJECT('id', \"id\")\r\n    \r\n    -- After\r\n    JSONB_BUILD_OBJECT('id', \"id\"::text)\r\n    ```\r\n\r\nThis ensures BigInt values are returned as JSON strings, preserving full precision when parsed in JavaScript.\r\n\r\n## Open roles at Prisma\r\n\r\nInterested in joining Prisma?
