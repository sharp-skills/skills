(pronounced _traffic_) is a modern HTTP reverse proxy and load balancer that makes deploying microservices easy.\nTraefik integrates with your existing infrastructure components ([Docker](https://www.docker.com/), [Swarm mode](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/), [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io), [Consul](https://www.consul.io/), [Etcd](https://coreos.com/etcd/), [Rancher v2](https://rancher.com), [Amazon ECS](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs), ...) and configures itself automatically and dynamically.\nPointing Traefik at your orchestrator should be the _only_ configuration step you need.\n\n---\n\n. **[Overview](#overview)** .\n**[Features](#features)** .\n**[Supported backends](#supported-backends)** .\n**[Quickstart](#quickstart)** .\n**[Web

smooth transition and to be aware of any breaking changes.\n\n\n## Overview\n\nImagine that you have deployed a bunch of microservices with the help of an orchestrator (like Swarm or Kubernetes) or a service registry (like etcd or consul).\nNow you want users to access these microservices, and you need a reverse proxy.\n\nTraditional reverse-proxies require that you configure _each_ route that will connect paths and subdomains to _each_ microservice. \nIn an environment where you add, remove, kill, upgrade, or scale your services _many_ times a day, the task of keeping the routes up to date becomes tedious. \n\n**This is when Traefik can help you!**\n\nTraefik listens to your service registry/orchestrator API and instantly generates the routes so your microservices are connected to the outside world -- without further intervention from your part. \n\n**Run Traefik and let it do the work for you!** \n_(But if you'd rather configure some of your routes manually, Traefik supports that too!)_\n\n![Architecture](docs/content/assets/img/traefik-architecture.png)\n\n## Features\n\n- Continuously updates its configuration (No restarts!)\n- Supports multiple load balancing algorithms\n- Provides HTTPS to your microservices by leveraging [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org) (wildcard certificates support)\n- Circuit breakers, retry\n- See the magic through its clean web UI\n- WebSocket, HTTP/2, gRPC ready\n- Provides metrics (Rest, Prometheus, Datadog, Statsd, InfluxDB 2.X)\n- Keeps access logs (JSON, CLF)\n- Fast\n- Exposes a Rest API\n- Packaged as a single binary file (made with :heart: with go) and available as an [official](https://hub.docker.com/r/_/traefik/) docker image\n\n## Supported Backends\n\n- [Docker](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/providers/docker/) / [Swarm mode](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/providers/docker/)\n- [Kubernetes](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/providers/kubernetes-crd/)\n- [ECS](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/providers/ecs/)\n-
