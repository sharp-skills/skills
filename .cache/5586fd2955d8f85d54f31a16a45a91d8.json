Of course developing on the <em>production</em> system was out of question, as it would have led to unbearably long feedback loops. I thus started looking around for existing containerised solutions, which were always lacking some key ingredient in order to suitably mock our target system (accounting, MPI, out of date software, ...).<p>I thus decided that it was worth it to make my own virtual cluster from scratch, learning a thing or two about SLURM in the process. Even though it satisfies the particular needs of the project I'm working on, I tried to keep vHPC as simple and versatile as possible.<p>I proposed the company to open source it, and as of this morning (CET) vHPC is FLOSS for others to use and tweak.
