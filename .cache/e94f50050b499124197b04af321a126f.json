You can think of it as an intelligent queue of React components in one \u201cslot\u201d. The ATC engine will automatically determine what order and when to show them. The rules can be useful to keep the user experience from getting spammy as your team launches more experiences at the same time. For instance, you can set it up so you only show one announcement modal per day max, or spread out in-app nudges to upgrade over a few weeks time.<p>We were surprised by how hard it was to build this. The main challenges were:\nIn order for the engine to respect the cool-offs and limits, we had to dig deep into the React rendering lifecycle to prevent the same component from rendering twice. This can happen when the same component is used in multiple Collections across the DOM tree. This is tough because a component can adhoc show up at any given time without notice due to the nature of dynamic web applications. We solved this by building a centralized client-side registry that keeps track of the DOM tree.<p>Air traffic control is decided server side, and we knew we didn\u2019t want to keep a <em>web socket</em> open indefinitely to render a simple component. So, we had to come up with a performant scheme that allowed the ATC logic tree to be transferred on initial render so the client-side can determine when each component should get rendered.\nFor the first release, we offer a library of pre-built React components that can be easily launched in your web application. We\u2019ll soon be adding the ability to launch any custom React components as well.<p>We built this server-driven UI approach because we believe it provides teams an option that balances quality and speed. It\u2019s also how companies like Uber, Pinterest and Rippling build and launch these in-app experiences internally, as well.<p>Compared to some of the existing no-code tools in the space, we believe this approach offers more control and flexibility.

The app will then create a DuckDB database from the parquet datasets that are on your device.  Right now - queries will only run on your device if the app is open and in the foreground.  To connect your device to the server - click the little blue &quot;server&quot; icon just to the right of the GizmoData logo at the top of the screen - the username, password, etc. are pre-filled for you - just click the blue: &quot;Connect <em>WebSocket</em>&quot; button at the bottom to get started.<p>When you issue a SQL query that is eligible for distribution from the GizmoEdge SQL app (at <a href=\"https://gizmoedge.gizmodata.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://gizmoedge.gizmodata.com</a>) - it should distribute and execute on your device (among others) in the collective, provided that they have downloaded a shard of data and are connected to the server.<p>I would be honored if folks tried the engine.  Please bear in mind - this is a prototype - it isn't <em>production</em> ready, yet.  It is currently read-only as well - but I'm working on a way to make it easy for folks to ingest data for distributed SQL execution in the near-future.<p>GizmoEdge is powered by DuckDB on the workers, and uses WebSockets for low-latency connections between the server and workers.

The app will then create a DuckDB database from the parquet datasets that are on your device.  Right now - queries will only run on your device if the app is open and in the foreground.  To connect your device to the server - click the little blue &quot;server&quot; icon just to the right of the GizmoData logo at the top of the screen - the username, password, etc. are pre-filled for you - just click the blue: &quot;Connect WebSocket&quot; button at the bottom to get started.<p>When you issue a SQL query that is eligible for distribution from the GizmoEdge SQL app (at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gizmoedge.gizmodata.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gizmoedge.gizmodata.com</a>) - it should distribute and execute on your device (among others) in the collective, provided that they have downloaded a shard of data and are connected to the server.<p>I would be honored if folks tried the engine.
