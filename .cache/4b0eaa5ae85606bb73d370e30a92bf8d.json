My express instance runs `@tus/server`, which uses `srvx` for API unification, and it internally uses flat array, not object, to write response headers - and those headers were broken. At first I've modified `srvx` internals to find out that change from Array to Object fixed my issue, but Node [docs](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#responsewriteheadstatuscode-statusmessage-headers) list array as supported value for headers - so it should work with arrays.\n\n## TL;DR\n\nI know it's a bit convoluted, but to put it simply \u2013 the issue is that with `morgan` enabled, instead of response headers like these:\n\n```http\nHTTP/1.1 200\u00a0\nX-Powered-By: Express\ncontent-type: text/plain\nx-testing: true\nDate: Tue, 17 Jun 2025 19:30:24 GMT\nConnection: keep-alive\nKeep-Alive: timeout=5\nTransfer-Encoding: chunked\n```\nI get these instead:\n```http\nHTTP/1.1 200\u00a0\nX-Powered-By: Express\nc: o\nt: r\nx: -\nDate: Tue, 17 Jun 2025 19:30:10 GMT\nConnection: keep-alive\nKeep-Alive: timeout=5\nTransfer-Encoding: chunked\n```\n\n## Environment information\n\n**Version**: `1.10.0`\n\n**Platform**: `Linux seba-stationary 6.8.0-60-generic #63-Ubuntu SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Tue Apr 15 19:04:15 UTC 2025 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux`\n\n**Node.js version**: `v22.16.0`\n\n## What steps will reproduce the bug?\n\nThere's a sample repository here: https://github.com/SPodjasek/poc-srvx-node-header-issue\n\n1.
