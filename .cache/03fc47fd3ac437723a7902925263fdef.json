"https://api.github.com/repos/teamhanko/hanko/zipball/backend/v2.4.0", "body": "This release brings several security, reliability, and usability improvements across Hanko\u2019s authentication stack. It includes stronger passcode options, better key management integration, more robust auth flows in Hanko Elements, improved device trust handling, and expanded localization support:\r\n\r\n## Alphanumeric passcodes\r\nIn addition to numeric passcodes, **Hanko** now supports optional **alphanumeric passcodes**. This increases entropy and makes passcode-based authentication more resilient against brute-force and guessing attacks.\r\n\r\n## External key providers (AWS KMS)\r\nHanko\u2019s token signing engine can now be configured to use external **HSMs and Key Management Systems**, currently only **AWS KMS** is supported. This allows teams with higher security requirements to keep signing keys fully managed outside of Hanko.\r\n\r\n## Security notifications\r\nHanko now optionally sends **email notifications for security-relevant actions** (enabled by default), for example when a new passkey is added to an account. These notifications help users detect suspicious activity early and improve overall account security.\r\n\r\n## PKCE by default in Hanko Elements\r\nHanko Elements now uses **PKCE-based flows by default**. This resolves several issues with third-party integrations, especially in setups where the backend is not running on the same domain as the frontend.\r\n\r\n## Multi-user device trust support\r\nDevice trust cookies are no longer overwritten on shared machines or when multiple users log into the same application. This improves reliability for **shared computers and multi-account setups** while keeping device trust intact per user.\r\n\r\n## Dutch localization\r\nHanko now officially supports **Dutch (NL)**. This includes UI text, backend mailing templates, and security notification emails, providing a more complete localized experience for Dutch-speaking users.\r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n* feat: make

Exchange)\r\nThe main feature of this release is PKCE support for 3rd-party OAuth flows of the Hanko API. When using Hanko with a mobile app, the `oauth_state` cookie might not be stored, so the `thirdparty_oauth` action now accepts a `code_verifier`. When the `code_verifier` ist set, the state cookie is optional, but the `code_verifier` is required when exchanging the Hanko token with the `exchange_token` action.\r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n* fix: user verification on passkey creation by @lfleischmann in https://github.com/teamhanko/hanko/pull/2239\r\n* fix: change module name corresponding to version by @FreddyDevelop in https://github.com/teamhanko/hanko/pull/2257\r\n* fix: export the Claims type by @FreddyDevelop in https://github.com/teamhanko/hanko/pull/2268\r\n* fix: check for SAML before email existence by @FreddyDevelop in https://github.com/teamhanko/hanko/pull/2270\r\n* Feat oauth prompt by @FreddyDevelop in https://github.com/teamhanko/hanko/pull/2260\r\n* PKCE OAuth flow by @FreddyDevelop in

"https://api.github.com/repos/teamhanko/hanko/zipball/backend/v2.1.1", "body": "This release includes a **license change** along with several improvements and fixes.\r\n\r\n## License change\r\n- The proprietary enterprise license in the /ee folder has been removed.\r\n- Hanko Backend is now fully licensed under AGPLv3.\r\n\r\n## Hanko Elements visual improvements\r\nWe\u2019ve refined the look and feel of `<hanko-auth>`, `<hanko-login>`, and `<hanko-registration>`:\r\n- Passcode views: user\u2019s email address is now highlighted.\r\n- Social SSO buttons:\r\n  - Logos and text (e.g. \u201cSign in with Google\u201d) are now centered.\r\n  - Order updated: SSO buttons now appear first, with the passkey option listed last.\r\n  - Passkey button icon removed for clearer visual separation from SSO options.\r\n- Login/registration switch UI in <hanko-auth>:\r\n  - Now centered at the bottom of the element (previously right-aligned).\r\n  - Text and link split for clarity \u2014 the prompt (e.g. \u201cAlready got an account?\u201d) is separate from the action link (e.g. \u201cSign in\u201d), making the link more prominent.\r\n\r\n## Hanko Elements `nonce` property added\r\n- Added an optional nonce property to Hanko Elements.\r\n- This enables a stricter Content Security Policy (CSP) without requiring `unsafe-inline`.\r\n- Improves overall security posture by allowing Hanko Element's inline styling in combination with a stricter CSP when a valid nonce is provided.\r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n* Update LICENSE by @FlxMgdnz in
