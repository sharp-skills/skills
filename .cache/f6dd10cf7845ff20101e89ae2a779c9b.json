I was building systems for all sorts of clients, and it felt like every other project involved scraping data from images\u2014<em>passports</em>, receipts, driver's licenses, you name it. It was always a huge pain. I'd either be hunting for some super-specific OCR API for one document type, or I'd be stuck using generic OCR and then trying to duct-tape it together with a mountain of fragile regex. It was a maintenance nightmare and I was juggling a dozen different API subscriptions.<p>The final straw, funny enough, came from my wife. She's an accountant and was complaining about having to manually check invoice numbers from PDFs to see if they'd already been paid. She just needed one field, the invoice number.

Why isn't there a tool where I can just point at what I want from any document and get a simple API for it?<p>So I built Struxs.<p>The workflow is pretty straightforward: you upload a sample image or PDF.
