So you can store JSON directly through the API.<p>For example:\n&#x2F;my-app&#x2F;dev -&gt; points to development database\n&#x2F;my-app&#x2F;prd -&gt; points to production database<p>Why I chose Atlas? It has a &quot;vectorSearch&quot; aggregation pipeline so it&#x27;s nice to do a semantic search as well. Similar to pgvector, which I plan to add as well.<p>So it&#x27;s also possible to query your data like so:<p>POST &quot;&#x2F;endpoint&quot; data &#x27;{ &quot;query&quot;: &quot;What are milestones for Project ABC?&quot; }&#x27;\n-&gt; You can either get array of objects as a result of semantic search, or a natural response like &quot;The milestones are...&quot; using OpenAI models or Claude, plan is to add more of them.<p>I would like to get some feedback on the project and features, it will mean a lot to me.", "title": "I'm making an open-source API gateway for MongoDB Atlas with vector search", "updated_at": "2024-09-20T16:52:36Z"}, {"_highlightResult": {"author": {"matchLevel": "none", "matchedWords": [], "value": "kiyanwang"}, "title": {"fullyHighlighted": false, "matchLevel": "full", "matchedWords": ["hono", "production"], "value": "5 ways to <em>hone</em> your <em>production</em> incident postmortems"}, "url": {"fullyHighlighted": false, "matchLevel": "full", "matchedWords": ["hono", "production"], "value": "http://tech.shutterstock.com/2016/11/11/5-ways-to-<em>hone</em>-your-<em>production</em>-incident-postmortems/"}}, "_tags": ["story", "author_kiyanwang", "story_13003806"], "author": "kiyanwang", "created_at": "2016-11-21T07:37:27Z", "created_at_i": 1479713847, "num_comments": 0, "objectID": "13003806", "points": 2, "story_id": 13003806, "title": "5 ways to hone your production incident postmortems", "updated_at": "2024-09-19T23:57:19Z", "url": "http://tech.shutterstock.com/2016/11/11/5-ways-to-hone-your-production-incident-postmortems/"}, {"_highlightResult": {"author": {"matchLevel": "none", "matchedWords": [], "value": "somid3"}, "title": {"fullyHighlighted": false, "matchLevel": "full", "matchedWords": ["hono", "production"], "value": "How Entrepreneurs Can <em>Hone</em> Their Management Skills to Fuel <em>Production</em>"}, "url": {"matchLevel": "none", "matchedWords": [], "value": "https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/293280"}}, "_tags": ["story", "author_somid3", "story_14228671"], "author": "somid3", "created_at": "2017-04-29T20:52:16Z", "created_at_i": 1493499136, "num_comments": 0, "objectID": "14228671", "points": 1, "story_id": 14228671, "title": "How Entrepreneurs Can Hone Their Management Skills to Fuel Production", "updated_at": "2024-09-20T00:44:25Z", "url": "https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/293280"}, {"_highlightResult": {"author": {"matchLevel": "none", "matchedWords": [], "value": "dshipper"}, "story_text": {"fullyHighlighted": false, "matchLevel": "full", "matchedWords": ["hono", "production"], "value": "Hey everyone,\nMy name is Dan Shipper and I'm a freshman in college.
