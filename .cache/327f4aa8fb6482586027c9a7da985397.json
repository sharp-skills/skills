We enable teams to store their secrets in a centralized location and distribute them anywhere from local development processes to staging/<em>production</em> environments.<p>Our Github is at <a href=\"https://github.com/infisical/infisical\">https://github.com/infisical/infisical</a>.<p>We previously worked at AWS, Figma, and another startup, where we frequently ran into problems dealing with secret management. For example, many companies used .env files to maintain their development secrets and struggled to keep secrets in sync amongst their teams (this routinely posed security and efficiency issues \u2014 secrets can get leaked or go missing). Some companies (especially bigger ones) used solutions like Vault which can be difficult to set up, maintain, and afford.<p>While secret managers exist, they\u2019re imperfect for many reasons: open-source solutions are either too complicated, not comprehensive, not user-friendly, or a mix of all three; there are nicer closed-source solutions but with no self-hosted options available. The gap we see is to make something that\u2019s simple, open-source, and powerful.<p>On the open-source front, our goal is to provide full transparency of our codebase and enable anyone in the community to build anything they want in an optimal secret management solution. If you need any feature or integration that we don\u2019t yet support, you can post an issue about it or directly send in a PR to be reviewed immediately.<p>You can inject the right set of secrets for any environment into your application by using the Infisical CLI together with your application start command (e.g. infisical run -- npm run dev). This removes the need to use a .env file. Everything stays encrypted with encryption/decryption operations occurring on the client-side \u2014 under the hood, secrets are encrypted by vault keys for which there are multiple copies of vault keys encrypted under the public key of each member of a vault (ensuring only members of vaults can decrypt secrets pertaining to that vault locally). An alternative way is to use our Open API - though it\u2019s a little complicated, and we\u2019re working on adding SDKs to abstract away the cryptography.<p>Infisical integrates with staging and <em>production</em> cloud services like AWS, Vercel, GitHub Actions, and Circle CI. We also added support for integrations with Docker, Kubernetes, and Terraform. Infisical is now a central source of truth for secrets across the entire development cycle from development to <em>production</em> with new integration releases every week.\nOne interesting thing is that, by default, our platform is end-to-end encrypted but users can opt out of that if they need to integrate with cloud platforms that require secrets to be sent in decrypted format (e.g. GitHub Actions, Vercel, Render). We\u2019re the only solution that we know of that offers this E2EE-with opt-out ability.<p>Since our last Show HN (<a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34510516\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34510516</a>), we\u2019ve layered authentication with 2FA (more MFA options coming soon) and upgraded all private key encryption/decryption steps to involve a 256-bit protected key decrypted by another key generated via Argon2id KDF from the user\u2019s password. We are starting the process of obtaining SOC2 and other security and compliance certifications. You can read more about our security here: <a href=\"https://infisical.com/docs/security/overview\">https://infisical.com/docs/security/overview</a><p>Beyond this, we\u2019ve added integrations with <em>PM2</em>, AWS Secrets Manager, AWS Parameter Store, Circle CI, Travis CI, GitLab CI/CD, Terraform and more. We\u2019ve also redesigned the main dashboard and added more advanced organizational structure for secrets. Lastly, we have added role-based access control, and improved our Kubernetes operator: your clusters are now auto-redeployed when secrets in Infisical change. In the coming weeks and months, we plan to add features like secret rotation, improved audit logs, SDKs and alerts; as well as increase the range of our integrations; and continue fortifying platform security and stability.<p>We\u2019ve launched this repo under the MIT license so any developer can use the platform. We don\u2019t charge individual developers or small teams\u2014all the integrations are fully available to everyone. We make money by charging a license fee for enterprise features as well as providing a hosted version and support.<p>If you found it interesting, you can see a demo video here: <a href=\"https://www.loom.com/share/9a8904c6ecc84d0899d53ee1f7a36385\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.loom.com/share/9a8904c6ecc84d0899d53ee1f7a36385</a><p>We\u2019d love for you to give Infisical a try (<a href=\"https://infisical.com\">https://infisical.com</a>) and provide any feedback.

We enable teams to store their secrets in a centralized location and distribute them anywhere from local development processes to staging&#x2F;production environments.<p>Our Github is at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;infisical&#x2F;infisical\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;infisical&#x2F;infisical</a>.<p>We previously worked at AWS, Figma, and another startup, where we frequently ran into problems dealing with secret management. For example, many companies used .env files to maintain their development secrets and struggled to keep secrets in sync amongst their teams (this routinely posed security and efficiency issues \u2014 secrets can get leaked or go missing). Some companies (especially bigger ones) used solutions like Vault which can be difficult to set up, maintain, and afford.<p>While secret managers exist, they\u2019re imperfect for many reasons: open-source solutions are either too complicated, not comprehensive, not user-friendly, or a mix of all three; there are nicer closed-source solutions but with no self-hosted options available. The gap we see is to make something that\u2019s simple, open-source, and powerful.<p>On the open-source front, our goal is to provide full transparency of our codebase and enable anyone in the community to build anything they want in an optimal secret management solution. If you need any feature or integration that we don\u2019t yet support, you can post an issue about it or directly send in a PR to be reviewed immediately.<p>You can inject the right set of secrets for any environment into your application by using the Infisical CLI together with your application start command (e.g. infisical run -- npm run dev). This removes the need to use a .env file. Everything stays encrypted with encryption&#x2F;decryption operations occurring on the client-side \u2014 under the hood, secrets are encrypted by vault keys for which there are multiple copies of vault keys encrypted under the public key of each member of a vault (ensuring only members of vaults can decrypt secrets pertaining to that vault locally). An alternative way is to use our Open API - though it\u2019s a little complicated, and we\u2019re working on adding SDKs to abstract away the cryptography.<p>Infisical integrates with staging and production cloud services like AWS, Vercel, GitHub Actions, and Circle CI. We also added support for integrations with Docker, Kubernetes, and Terraform. Infisical is now a central source of truth for secrets across the entire development cycle from development to production with new integration releases every week.\nOne interesting thing is that, by default, our platform is end-to-end encrypted but users can opt out of that if they need to integrate with cloud platforms that require secrets to be sent in decrypted format (e.g. GitHub Actions, Vercel, Render). We\u2019re the only solution that we know of that offers this E2EE-with opt-out ability.<p>Since our last Show HN (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=34510516\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=34510516</a>), we\u2019ve layered authentication with 2FA (more MFA options coming soon) and upgraded all private key encryption&#x2F;decryption steps to involve a 256-bit protected key decrypted by another key generated via Argon2id KDF from the user\u2019s password. We are starting the process of obtaining SOC2 and other security and compliance certifications. You can read more about our security here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;infisical.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;security&#x2F;overview\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;infisical.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;security&#x2F;overview</a><p>Beyond this, we\u2019ve added integrations with PM2, AWS Secrets Manager, AWS Parameter Store, Circle CI, Travis CI, GitLab CI&#x2F;CD, Terraform and more. We\u2019ve also redesigned the main dashboard and added more advanced organizational structure for secrets. Lastly, we have added role-based access control, and improved our Kubernetes operator: your clusters are now auto-redeployed when secrets in Infisical change. In the coming weeks and months, we plan to add features like secret rotation, improved audit logs, SDKs and alerts; as well as increase the range of our integrations; and continue fortifying platform security and stability.<p>We\u2019ve launched this repo under the MIT license so any developer can use the platform. We don\u2019t charge individual developers or small teams\u2014all the integrations are fully available to everyone. We make money by charging a license fee for enterprise features as well as providing a hosted version and support.<p>If you found it interesting, you can see a demo video here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.loom.com&#x2F;share&#x2F;9a8904c6ecc84d0899d53ee1f7a36385\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.loom.com&#x2F;share&#x2F;9a8904c6ecc84d0899d53ee1f7a36385</a><p>We\u2019d love for you to give Infisical a try (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;infisical.com\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;infisical.com</a>) and provide any feedback.

The context switching wasn\u2019t always easy, but having the coding agent on one virtual desktop and company work on another made the rhythm surprisingly smooth.

At times I felt super human when the AI got a complex feature implemented correctly in the first shot (and obviously there were a few times when it was extremely frustrating).<p>What helped tremendously was that I asked the AI to draft a full spec based on our existing web app, fed it screenshots and Figma mocks. Sometimes these specs were a few pages long for a simple feature including API, data models, localisations, UI mockups, and error handling.

I still had to debug, make architectural decisions, and understand the tricky parts, but the heavy lifting moved to the tools.<p>This experience changed my view on a long-standing question: Should CEOs code? The historical answer was usually &quot;not really.&quot; But with agentic coding, I believe the calculus shifts. Understanding what AI can and can\u2019t do, how engineering workflows will change, and how non-engineers can now contribute directly is becoming strategically important. You only get that understanding by building something end-to-end, and I believe it's important that CEOs experience this themselves (the positives &amp; the frustrations).<p>The bigger shift for me was realizing how this changes the entire software workflow. Designers can hand over mocks that agents turn directly into working components. PMs can produce detailed specs that generate real code instead of just guiding it. Even non-engineering teams can create small internal tools without blocking developers. Engineers don\u2019t disappear\u2014they move upward into architecture, debugging, constraints, and system-level reasoning.
