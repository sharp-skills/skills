"selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nJust wanted to raise awareness about something that many Steam users (myself included) didn't know about \u2014 until it was too late:\n\n\n---\n\nThe Steam Web API Key scam.\n\nThis is a legitimate feature created by Steam for developers to interact with your inventory.\nBut if you're not careful, a malicious site or extension can silently activate it on your account without your knowledge \u2014 and then use it to scam you.\n\n\n---\n\nHow does the scam work?\n\nYou get tricked into logging into a fake or compromised site.\n\nThe attacker activates an API Key on your account (usually with the domain localhost).\n\nThis key allows them to intercept your trade offers, cancel them, and resend a copy of the same offer to a fake lookalike account.\n\nThe trade looks normal, you confirm it, and your item is gone.\n\n\n\n---\n\nHow to check if you're safe:\n\nGo to this link:\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey\n\nIf you see a key activated with any domain (especially localhost),\nClick: \"Revoke My Steam Web API Key\" immediately.\n\nIf it says:\n\n&gt; You do not have a Steam Web API Key\nYou're safe (for now).\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n\nTips to protect yourself:\n\nNever trade through the browser.
