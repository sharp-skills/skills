This is Ben from Reality Defender (<a href=\"https://www.realitydefender.com\">https://www.realitydefender.com</a>). We build real-time multimodal and multi-model deepfake detection for Fortune 100s and governments all over the world. (We even won the RSAC Innovation Showcase award for our work: <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/reality-defender-wins-most-innovative-startup-at-rsa-conference-2024-innovation-sandbox-302137326.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/reality-defender-wi...</a>)<p>Today, we\u2019re excited to share our public API and SDK, allowing anyone to access our platform with 2 lines of code: <a href=\"https://www.realitydefender.com/api\">https://www.realitydefender.com/api</a><p>Back in W22, we launched our product to detect AI-generated media across audio, video, and images: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30766050\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30766050</a><p>That post kicked off conversations with devs, security teams, researchers, and governments. The most common question: &quot;Can we get API/SDK access to build deepfake detection into our product?&quot;<p>We\u2019ve heard that from solo devs building moderation tools, fintechs adding ID verification, founders running marketplaces, and infrastructure companies protecting video calls and onboarding flows. They weren\u2019t asking us to build anything new; they simply wanted access to what we already had so they could plug it in and move forward.<p>After running pilots and engagements with customers, we\u2019re finally ready to share our public API and SDK. Now anyone can embed deepfake detection with just two lines of code, starting at the low price of free.<p><a href=\"https://www.realitydefender.com/api\">https://www.realitydefender.com/api</a><p>Our new developer tools support detection across images, voice, video, and text \u2014 with the former two available as part of the free tier. If your product touches KYC, UGC, support workflows, communications, marketplaces, or identity layers, you can now embed real-time detection directly in your stack. It runs in the cloud, and longstanding clients using our platform have also deployed on-prem, at the edge, or on fully airgapped systems.<p>SDKs are currently available in Python, Java, Rust, TypeScript, and Go. The first 50 scans per month are free, with usage-based pricing beyond that. If you\u2019re working on something that requires other features or streaming access (like real-time voice or video), email us directly at yc@realitydefender.com<p>Much has changed since 2022. The threats we imagined back then are now showing up in everyday support tickets and incident reports. We\u2019ve witnessed voice deepfakes targeting bank call centers to commit real-time fraud; fabricated documents and AI-generated selfies slip through KYC and IDV onboarding systems; fake dating profiles, AI-generated marketplace sellers, and \u201cverified\u201d influencers impersonating real people. Political disinformation videos and synthetic media leaks have triggered real-world legal and PR crises. Even reviews, support transcripts, and impersonation scripts are increasingly being generated by AI.\nDetection remains harder than we first expected since we began in 2021. New generation methods emerge every few weeks that invalidate prior assumptions. This is why we are committed to building every layer of this ourselves. We don\u2019t license or white-label detection models; everything we deploy is built in-house by our team.<p>Since our original launch, we\u2019ve worked with tier-one banks, global governments, and media companies to deploy detection inside their highest-risk workflows. However, we always believed the need wasn\u2019t limited to large institutions, but everywhere. It showed up in YC office hours, in early bug reports, and in group chats after our last HN post.<p>We\u2019ve taken our time to make sure this was built well, flexible enough for startups, and battle-tested enough to trust in <em>production</em>. The API you can use today is the same one powering many of our enterprise deployments.<p>Our goal is to make Reality Defender feel like Stripe, Twilio, or <em>Plaid</em> \u2014 an invisible, trusted layer that you can drop into your system to protect what matters. We feel deepfake detection is a key component of critical infrastructure, and like any good infrastructure, it should be modular, reliable, and boring (in the best possible way).<p>Reality Defender is already in the Zoom marketplace and will be on the Teams marketplace soon. We will also power deepfake detection for identity workflows, support platforms, and internal trust and safety pipelines.<p>If you're building something where trust, identity, or content integrity matter, or if you\u2019ve run into weird edge cases you can\u2019t explain, we\u2019d love to hear from you.<p>You can get started here: <a href=\"https://realitydefender.com/api\">https://realitydefender.com/api</a><p>Or you can try us for free two different ways:<p>1) 1-click add to Zoom / Teams to try in your own calls immediately.<p>2) Email us up to 50 files at yc@realitydefender.com and we\u2019ll scan them for you \u2014 no setup required.<p>Thanks again to the HN community for helping launch us three years ago.

This is Ben from Reality Defender (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.realitydefender.com\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.realitydefender.com</a>). We build real-time multimodal and multi-model deepfake detection for Fortune 100s and governments all over the world. (We even won the RSAC Innovation Showcase award for our work: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.prnewswire.com&#x2F;news-releases&#x2F;reality-defender-wins-most-innovative-startup-at-rsa-conference-2024-innovation-sandbox-302137326.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.prnewswire.com&#x2F;news-releases&#x2F;reality-defender-wi...</a>)<p>Today, we\u2019re excited to share our public API and SDK, allowing anyone to access our platform with 2 lines of code: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.realitydefender.com&#x2F;api\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.realitydefender.com&#x2F;api</a><p>Back in W22, we launched our product to detect AI-generated media across audio, video, and images: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=30766050\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=30766050</a><p>That post kicked off conversations with devs, security teams, researchers, and governments. The most common question: &quot;Can we get API&#x2F;SDK access to build deepfake detection into our product?&quot;<p>We\u2019ve heard that from solo devs building moderation tools, fintechs adding ID verification, founders running marketplaces, and infrastructure companies protecting video calls and onboarding flows. They weren\u2019t asking us to build anything new; they simply wanted access to what we already had so they could plug it in and move forward.<p>After running pilots and engagements with customers, we\u2019re finally ready to share our public API and SDK. Now anyone can embed deepfake detection with just two lines of code, starting at the low price of free.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.realitydefender.com&#x2F;api\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.realitydefender.com&#x2F;api</a><p>Our new developer tools support detection across images, voice, video, and text \u2014 with the former two available as part of the free tier. If your product touches KYC, UGC, support workflows, communications, marketplaces, or identity layers, you can now embed real-time detection directly in your stack. It runs in the cloud, and longstanding clients using our platform have also deployed on-prem, at the edge, or on fully airgapped systems.<p>SDKs are currently available in Python, Java, Rust, TypeScript, and Go. The first 50 scans per month are free, with usage-based pricing beyond that. If you\u2019re working on something that requires other features or streaming access (like real-time voice or video), email us directly at yc@realitydefender.com<p>Much has changed since 2022. The threats we imagined back then are now showing up in everyday support tickets and incident reports. We\u2019ve witnessed voice deepfakes targeting bank call centers to commit real-time fraud; fabricated documents and AI-generated selfies slip through KYC and IDV onboarding systems; fake dating profiles, AI-generated marketplace sellers, and \u201cverified\u201d influencers impersonating real people. Political disinformation videos and synthetic media leaks have triggered real-world legal and PR crises. Even reviews, support transcripts, and impersonation scripts are increasingly being generated by AI.\nDetection remains harder than we first expected since we began in 2021. New generation methods emerge every few weeks that invalidate prior assumptions. This is why we are committed to building every layer of this ourselves. We don\u2019t license or white-label detection models; everything we deploy is built in-house by our team.<p>Since our original launch, we\u2019ve worked with tier-one banks, global governments, and media companies to deploy detection inside their highest-risk workflows. However, we always believed the need wasn\u2019t limited to large institutions, but everywhere. It showed up in YC office hours, in early bug reports, and in group chats after our last HN post.<p>We\u2019ve taken our time to make sure this was built well, flexible enough for startups, and battle-tested enough to trust in production. The API you can use today is the same one powering many of our enterprise deployments.<p>Our goal is to make Reality Defender feel like Stripe, Twilio, or Plaid \u2014 an invisible, trusted layer that you can drop into your system to protect what matters. We feel deepfake detection is a key component of critical infrastructure, and like any good infrastructure, it should be modular, reliable, and boring (in the best possible way).<p>Reality Defender is already in the Zoom marketplace and will be on the Teams marketplace soon. We will also power deepfake detection for identity workflows, support platforms, and internal trust and safety pipelines.<p>If you&#x27;re building something where trust, identity, or content integrity matter, or if you\u2019ve run into weird edge cases you can\u2019t explain, we\u2019d love to hear from you.<p>You can get started here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;realitydefender.com&#x2F;api\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;realitydefender.com&#x2F;api</a><p>Or you can try us for free two different ways:<p>1) 1-click add to Zoom &#x2F; Teams to try in your own calls immediately.<p>2) Email us up to 50 files at yc@realitydefender.com and we\u2019ll scan them for you \u2014 no setup required.<p>Thanks again to the HN community for helping launch us three years ago. It\u2019s been a wild ride, and we\u2019re excited to share something new. We live on HN ourselves and will be here for all your feedback.

Think <em>Plaid</em> for Latam.<p>We were previously building a payments startup (something like Venmo) in Europe and when expanding to Latam realised how hard it is to connect to legacy infrastructure, whether it is to access data, validate bank accounts or process payments. We\u2019ve also been working in fintech in Europe for the past few years (at companies like Revolut) and one of us comes from a traditional financial services background. We\u2019ve seen the impact open banking technology, which has become common in Europe, has had on providing end-users with more transparent\nand fair offerings and on lowering barriers for fintech developers to get started and launch innovative new products. But this technology hasn't made it into Latam yet, so we saw a big opportunity and started Belvo to solve that.<p>Belvo allows end-users to connect their financial data to new fintech apps across Latam. We\u2019ve seen a number of relevant use cases for our product so far. For personal and business finance apps, we allow users to connect bank accounts and view them in one place through account consolidation. This allows developers to provide better spending analytics and proactive recommendations. Business-oriented finance apps can reduce manual errors and costs via automated accounting by syncing bank feeds and reconciling transactions on a recurring basis. We\u2019ve also seen that digital-first banks and wallets can use us to build in-house personal finance managers and authenticate the owner of any bank account - thus streamlining their know-your-client (KYC) processes. We also enable credit providers to build better and faster experiences for borrowers. Instead of having to build onboarding flows or asking users to self-report or upload their information, data can be synced via our API. Fraud risk can also be reduced and scoring improved by accessing more granular and broad data.<p>Currently we allow end-users to connect banks and bank-like sources to fintech apps. That being said, our goal is to aggregate all relevant financial data sources, not just banks. This is particularly important in Latam, where 50% of the population is unbanked. In this context, sources such as service providers (think prepaid phone, prepaid TV, electricity bills), digital wallets and gig-economy apps are relevant for both users and fintech apps. These are typically paid in cash and don\u2019t go through a bank statement or debit card but all have portals where consumption and spend can be analysed and categorised. Becoming the \u201csource of truth\u201d for all this data is pretty tricky as all data sources have different formats, ways to access, granularity, etc. and that\u2019s something we\u2019re looking to solve.<p>The process of connecting accounts to fintech apps is built on the premise of full and strong user consent to data sharing. Security / privacy is something we\u2019ve been focusing on since day 1. Our engineering, infrastructure and data teams have past experience in working on products with similar complexities.<p>We went live in January in Mexico, our first market.
