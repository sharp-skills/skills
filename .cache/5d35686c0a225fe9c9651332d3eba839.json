This release marks a significant milestone in the evolution of XOC, which has been powering commercial compilers and achieving remarkable performance and stability in <em>production</em> environments.\nAbout XOC Compiler Framework The XOC Compiler Framework is an industry-grade compiler infrastructure designed to support the compilation and analysis of both static languages (such as C, C++, Java) and dynamic languages (such as JavaScript). It is the result of independent research and development efforts and has been battle-tested in real-world applications, including Alibaba's YunOS/<em>AliOS</em> mobile operating system and Cambricon's proprietary compiler for AI chips. XOC is based on the open-source compiler framework initially released by Alibaba in 2015. Since then, it has been continuously developed and enhanced to provide a robust and flexible foundation for compiler development<p>Key Features and Advantages Multi-Level Intermediate Representations (IR): XOC provides a hierarchical IR system that enables efficient code transformation. It supports the composition of arbitrary simple IRs into complex IR trees to accurately represent the syntax of various languages. Retargetable Code Generation: XOC includes XGEN, a retargetable machine code generator capable of producing code for multiple architectures, including ARM and x86. XGEN provides features such as IR2OR translation, instruction scheduling, register allocation, instruction packaging, and assembly code generation. Comprehensive Optimization and Analysis Tools: XOC offers a rich set of optimization and analysis tools, including aggressive flow-sensitive alias analysis, field-sensitive alias analysis, Register and Memory SSA (Static Single Assignment) forms, interprocedural analysis, inlining, dead code elimination, copy propagation, GCSE, GVN, and sophisticated control flow and peephole optimizations. Stand-Alone Algorithm Library: XOC does not rely on any standard library, providing all basic algorithm libraries such as Vector, List, Map, Dense Bitset, Sparse Bitset, Graph, Mempool, Big-Integer, Linear Algebraic library, File Operations, and Linear Programming Solver. Modular Design: XOC is designed to be easily integrated into other projects as an independent module, making it highly adaptable for various use cases. C Frontend (XOCFE): XOCFE is a concise and clear C compiler frontend that outputs an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). It supports pure C99 and is easy to understand and modify. Polyhedral Transformation (XPOLY): XOC includes XPOLY, a tool for polyhedral transformation, linear programming solving, and polyhedral-based dependence analysis, enabling advanced loop optimization.<p>Commercial Applications and Stability The XOC Compiler Framework has been deployed in numerous commercial applications, demonstrating its reliability and performance. It has been used to optimize Android applications on YunOS, achieving significant performance improvements. Additionally, XOC has been utilized in the development of dexpro, a Java program analysis tool for detecting potential bugs and performance issues, as well as in static analysis tools for enhancing the execution speed of JavaScript engines like V8.<p>Getting Started To start using XOC and its components, visit the following repositories:<p>XOC Compiler Infrastructure: <a href=\"https://github.com/stevenknown/xoc\">https://github.com/stevenknown/xoc</a>\nXOCFE C Frontend: <a href=\"https://github.com/stevenknown/xocfe\">https://github.com/stevenknown/xocfe</a>\nXGEN Code Generator: <a href=\"https://github.com/stevenknown/xgen\">https://github.com/stevenknown/xgen</a>\nXPOLY Polyhedral Transformation: <a href=\"https://github.com/stevenknown/xpoly\">https://github.com/stevenknown/xpoly</a><p>For detailed build instructions and documentation, please refer to the respective repository README files.

I'm Kanishka Nithin, founder of AIGr.id (<a href=\"https://www.aigr.id\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.aigr.id</a>). \nWe\u2019re building AIGr.id \u2014 a polycentric network of independent, modular AI that can coordinate, exchange data, and compose into higher-level intelligence \u2014 all within a decentralized and plural ecosystem. Rings collective intelligence?<p>In simpler terms: We\u2019re trying to make it possible for people to produce, remix, operate, distribute and consume AI systems the way we use the internet\u2014 openly, collaboratively, and without needing to centralize everything into one mega-model owned by one mega-entity.\nJust like internet of intelligence.<p>Today\u2019s AI landscape is: \nCentralized, resource-heavy systems demand vast funding, compute, and talent\u2014excluding much of the world.\nControlled by a few powerful actors prioritizing profit over public good.\nParticipation is limited, deepening inequality in AI benefits.\nFragmented and siloed, with no open protocols for AI coordination\nWe believe it's time to reimagine AI as collective intelligence, as shared commons \u2014 poly-centric, collaborative, composable, inclusive, and guided by values beyond profit.<p>What\u2019s different about our approach is that we\u2019re not trying to build \u201cthe one true model\u201d \u2014 we\u2019re trying to make it easier for people to build, remix, run, and govern their own AI systems, together. We want a world where AGI doesn\u2019t have to be monolithic \u2014 where different models, agents, and collectives can evolve side by side, coordinate, and even argue if they need to. Plural, by design.<p>At the core of AIGr.id is OpenOS.AI, a distributed AI operating system. It is a full stack <em>AIOS</em> that spans everything from low-level compute orchestration to higher-level cognition, coordination, governance and economic policy. Think of it as a programmable substrate for building and running decentralized AI systems \u2014 across any infrastructure, in any topology.<p>Developers can use shared protocols, primitives, and templates to compose AI systems \u2014 models, agents, cognitive workflows \u2014 and plug them into running grids. These grids can be public, private, federated, or even permissionless. Each grid can maintain its own sovereignty (values, rules, trust mechanisms), but still remain interoperable with others. It's designed for a world where we expect many intelligences to coexist, rather than one model to rule them all.<p>We\u2019re in beta and will be kicking off more extensive scale testing during our upcoming testnet phase. \nIf this scratches an itch for you, or just want to jam on open systems \u2014 we\u2019d love your feedback. If you're interested in joining the testnet, you can join our discord @ <a href=\"https://discord.gg/W24vZFNB\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://discord.gg/W24vZFNB</a> \u2014 we\u2019d be excited to have you involved early.<p>Docs, GitHub, and the paper are all linked at <a href=\"https://www.aigr.id\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.aigr.id</a>\nCurious what you think \u2014 critiques, weird use cases, edge cases, counterpoints \u2014 all welcome.<p>Our own background is what pushed us into this problem. Before this, we were a 4-person crew running one of the largest real-time AI inference workloads in India. We were doing around 500K inferences/sec across 80\u201390 models simultaneously, supporting 35+ public-sector use cases \u2014 mostly video analytics. We were operating across federated and private infrastructure in real time, processing millions of frames per second. We didn\u2019t rely on cloud providers or commercial frameworks.<p>Our market was distorted by deprioritized infrastructure investment and choosing to grow within our earnings means the only way to survive was by being ruthlessly efficient: creating frameworks that automated end to end <em>production</em>, operation, distribution and maintenance life cycle of AI -- everything at scale reliably without or with minimal human intervention \u2014 so four of us could actually live our lives, too.<p>So in a way, AIGr.id was born out of necessity.

Rings collective intelligence?<p>In simpler terms: We\u2019re trying to make it possible for people to produce, remix, operate, distribute and consume AI systems the way we use the internet\u2014 openly, collaboratively, and without needing to centralize everything into one mega-model owned by one mega-entity.\nJust like internet of intelligence.<p>Today\u2019s AI landscape is: \nCentralized, resource-heavy systems demand vast funding, compute, and talent\u2014excluding much of the world.\nControlled by a few powerful actors prioritizing profit over public good.\nParticipation is limited, deepening inequality in AI benefits.\nFragmented and siloed, with no open protocols for AI coordination\nWe believe it&#x27;s time to reimagine AI as collective intelligence, as shared commons \u2014 poly-centric, collaborative, composable, inclusive, and guided by values beyond profit.<p>What\u2019s different about our approach is that we\u2019re not trying to build \u201cthe one true model\u201d \u2014 we\u2019re trying to make it easier for people to build, remix, run, and govern their own AI systems, together. We want a world where AGI doesn\u2019t have to be monolithic \u2014 where different models, agents, and collectives can evolve side by side, coordinate, and even argue if they need to. Plural, by design.<p>At the core of AIGr.id is OpenOS.AI, a distributed AI operating system. It is a full stack AIOS that spans everything from low-level compute orchestration to higher-level cognition, coordination, governance and economic policy. Think of it as a programmable substrate for building and running decentralized AI systems \u2014 across any infrastructure, in any topology.<p>Developers can use shared protocols, primitives, and templates to compose AI systems \u2014 models, agents, cognitive workflows \u2014 and plug them into running grids. These grids can be public, private, federated, or even permissionless. Each grid can maintain its own sovereignty (values, rules, trust mechanisms), but still remain interoperable with others. It&#x27;s designed for a world where we expect many intelligences to coexist, rather than one model to rule them all.<p>We\u2019re in beta and will be kicking off more extensive scale testing during our upcoming testnet phase. \nIf this scratches an itch for you, or just want to jam on open systems \u2014 we\u2019d love your feedback. If you&#x27;re interested in joining the testnet, you can join our discord @ <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;discord.gg&#x2F;W24vZFNB\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;discord.gg&#x2F;W24vZFNB</a> \u2014 we\u2019d be excited to have you involved early.<p>Docs, GitHub, and the paper are all linked at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.aigr.id\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.aigr.id</a>\nCurious what you think \u2014 critiques, weird use cases, edge cases, counterpoints \u2014 all welcome.<p>Our own background is what pushed us into this problem. Before this, we were a 4-person crew running one of the largest real-time AI inference workloads in India. We were doing around 500K inferences&#x2F;sec across 80\u201390 models simultaneously, supporting 35+ public-sector use cases \u2014 mostly video analytics. We were operating across federated and private infrastructure in real time, processing millions of frames per second. We didn\u2019t rely on cloud providers or commercial frameworks.<p>Our market was distorted by deprioritized infrastructure investment and choosing to grow within our earnings means the only way to survive was by being ruthlessly efficient: creating frameworks that automated end to end production, operation, distribution and maintenance life cycle of AI -- everything at scale reliably without or with minimal human intervention \u2014 so four of us could actually live our lives, too.<p>So in a way, AIGr.id was born out of necessity. It&#x27;s the system we wish we had \u2014 one that treats intelligence as something modular, networked, composable, orchestratable, shareable, and governable \u2013 in a collective way.", "title": "Show HN:[Opensource] AIgr.id\u2013Polycentric Infrastructure for Open and Plural AI", "updated_at": "2025-07-23T17:36:43Z", "url": "https://www.aigr.id"}, {"_highlightResult": {"author": {"matchLevel": "none", "matchedWords": [], "value": "steven_known"}, "story_text": {"fullyHighlighted": false, "matchLevel": "full", "matchedWords": ["axios", "production"], "value": "Hello everyone,\nI am thrilled to announce the release of the XOC Compiler Framework 1.6.0, a retargetable compiler infrastructure licensed under the BSD license.
