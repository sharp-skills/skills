View the [code](https://github.com/vercel/commerce/tree/v1), [demo](https://commerce-v1.vercel.store), and [release notes](https://github.com/vercel/commerce/releases/tag/v1).\n\n## Providers\n\nVercel will only be actively maintaining a Shopify version [as outlined in our vision and strategy for Next.js Commerce](https://github.com/vercel/commerce/pull/966).\n\nVercel is happy to partner and work with any commerce provider to help them get a similar template up and running and listed below. Alternative providers should be able to fork this repository and swap out the `lib/shopify` file with their own implementation while leaving the rest of the template mostly unchanged.\n\n- Shopify (this repository)\n- [BigCommerce](https://github.com/bigcommerce/nextjs-commerce) ([Demo](https://next-commerce-v2.vercel.app/))\n- [Ecwid by Lightspeed](https://github.com/Ecwid/ecwid-nextjs-commerce/) ([Demo](https://ecwid-nextjs-commerce.vercel.app/))\n- [Geins](https://github.com/geins-io/vercel-nextjs-commerce) ([Demo](https://geins-nextjs-commerce-starter.vercel.app/))\n- [Medusa](https://github.com/medusajs/vercel-commerce) ([Demo](https://medusa-nextjs-commerce.vercel.app/))\n- [Prodigy Commerce](https://github.com/prodigycommerce/nextjs-commerce) ([Demo](https://prodigy-nextjs-commerce.vercel.app/))\n- [Saleor](https://github.com/saleor/nextjs-commerce) ([Demo](https://saleor-commerce.vercel.app/))\n- [Shopware](https://github.com/shopwareLabs/vercel-commerce) ([Demo](https://shopware-vercel-commerce-react.vercel.app/))\n- [Swell](https://github.com/swellstores/verswell-commerce) ([Demo](https://verswell-commerce.vercel.app/))\n- [Umbraco](https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco.VercelCommerce.Demo) ([Demo](https://vercel-commerce-demo.umbraco.com/))\n- [Wix](https://github.com/wix/headless-templates/tree/main/nextjs/commerce) ([Demo](https://wix-nextjs-commerce.vercel.app/))\n- [Fourthwall](https://github.com/FourthwallHQ/vercel-commerce) ([Demo](https://vercel-storefront.fourthwall.app/))\n\n> Note: Providers, if you are looking to use similar products for your demo, you can [download these assets](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1q_bKerjrwZgHwCw0ovfUMW6He9VtepO_/view?usp=sharing).\n\n## Integrations\n\nIntegrations enable upgraded or additional functionality for Next.js Commerce\n\n- [Orama](https://github.com/oramasearch/nextjs-commerce) ([Demo](https://vercel-commerce.oramasearch.com/))\n\n  - Upgrades search to include typeahead with dynamic re-rendering, vector-based similarity search, and JS-based configuration.\n  - Search runs entirely in the browser for smaller catalogs or on a CDN for larger.\n\n- [React Bricks](https://github.com/ReactBricks/nextjs-commerce-rb) ([Demo](https://nextjs-commerce.reactbricks.com/))\n  - Edit pages, product details, and footer content visually using [React Bricks](https://www.reactbricks.com) visual headless CMS.\n\n## Running locally\n\nYou will need to use the environment variables [defined in `.env.example`](.env.example) to run Next.js Commerce. It's recommended you use [Vercel Environment Variables](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/projects/environment-variables) for this, but a `.env` file is all that is necessary.\n\n> Note: You should not commit your `.env` file or it will expose secrets that will allow others to control your Shopify store.\n\n1. Install Vercel CLI: `npm i -g vercel`\n2. Link local instance with Vercel and GitHub accounts (creates `.vercel` directory): `vercel link`\n3. Download your environment variables: `vercel env pull`\n\n```bash\npnpm install\npnpm dev\n```\n\nYour app should now be running on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/).\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Expand if you work at Vercel and want to run locally and / or contribute</summary>\n\n1. Run `vc link`.\n1. Select the `Vercel Solutions` scope.\n1. Connect to the existing `commerce-shopify` project.\n1. Run `vc env pull` to get environment variables.\n1.
