With 98% less configuration and without the need for DevOps or Cloud expertise.<p>Unlike with other solutions, you can deploy both serverless (AWS lambda-based) and more traditional (container-based) applications. Stacktape also supports 20+ infrastructure components, including SQL databases, Load balancers, MongoDB Atlas clusters, Batch-jobs, Kafka topics, Redis clusters &amp; more.<p>Besides infrastructure management, Stacktape handles source code packaging, deployments, local/remote development, and much more. It also comes with a VScode extension and local development studio (GUI).<p>Stacktape is a IaaC tool. The configuration can be written in YAML, JSON, or <em>Typescript</em>. A typical <em>production</em>-grade REST API is ~30 lines of config (compared to ~600-800 lines of CloudFormation/Terraform).

But the complexity of running this in production can be overwhelming even for a team of dedicated DevOps specialists. Or I could go with Heroku. But I\u2019m not willing to pay 5-10 times more for my infrastructure just because my app was easier to deploy. I could also choose Serverless framework. But If my use case requires more than Lambda functions, I need to read through 100s of pages of AWS documentation figuring out how to configure VPCs, Security groups, Route tables and more\u2026<p>Until now, I could choose either &quot;powerful&quot; or &quot;easy&quot;. Today, after 2.5 years of development, I\u2019m happy to introduce another option.<p>Stacktape is a DevOps-free cloud framework that\u2019s both powerful and easy at the same time. It allows you to develop, deploy and run applications on AWS. With 98% less configuration and without the need for DevOps or Cloud expertise.<p>Unlike with other solutions, you can deploy both serverless (AWS lambda-based) and more traditional (container-based) applications. Stacktape also supports 20+ infrastructure components, including SQL databases, Load balancers, MongoDB Atlas clusters, Batch-jobs, Kafka topics, Redis clusters &amp; more.<p>Besides infrastructure management, Stacktape handles source code packaging, deployments, local&#x2F;remote development, and much more. It also comes with a VScode extension and local development studio (GUI).<p>Stacktape is a IaaC tool. The configuration can be written in YAML, JSON, or Typescript. A typical production-grade REST API is ~30 lines of config (compared to ~600-800 lines of CloudFormation&#x2F;Terraform). The deployment can be done using a CLI or a programmatic SDK.<p>Stacktape is a premium tool with a forever-free tier. I\u2019ll be very happy if you give it a try and let me know what you think.", "title": "Show HN: Stacktape \u2013 Full power of AWS with Heroku-like experience", "updated_at": "2025-09-05T21:11:30Z", "url": "https://www.stacktape.com/"}, {"_highlightResult": {"author": {"matchLevel": "none", "matchedWords": [], "value": "gilbarbara"}, "story_text": {"fullyHighlighted": false, "matchLevel": "full", "matchedWords": ["typescript", "production"], "value": "Agent Hub MCP enables ANY MCP-compatible AI assistant to coordinate across repositories and platforms.
